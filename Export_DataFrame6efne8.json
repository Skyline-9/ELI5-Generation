Autoimmune diseases are on the rise everywhere in the developed world. One hypothesis for this rise is the comparative lack of intestinal parasites in the developed world.

Whether it's symptomatic or not is up to the individual. A very good explanation of the mechanism of reaction which begins in our intestines is available in Dr Mercola's report on gluten intolerance and gluten allergies, but can be roughly summarized by saying that out digestive enzymes react wrongly, we experience inflammatory responses in the body, and we don't digest things very well when it's in there. Less severe reactions go unnoticed but most cases of gluten intolerance have gone undiagnosed because we only have reliable black-and-white tests for celiac disease, not gradients of intolerance.\n\n\nSo why is this? The answer to OP's question is the same answer to many other health questions: the longer human kind has evolved alongside a condition the better suited it is for our health. This applies the same to exposure to all kinds of other processed items which we react badly to. With gluten, we've only been agriculturally revolutionized for a few thousand years, a relatively short evolutionary window when compared to the hundreds of thousands of years eating other things, but it gets even better: during this short few thousand year period we've only been selectively breeding (ie genetically modifying) bread to be softer for an even shorter period, which graphs onto a steeply inclining slope to the present. \n\nThe long chain protein that holds everything together and makes our soft bread today so different from the shitty rock bread we had thousands of years ago is gluten. Interesting nobody has reactions to gluten itself but to a molecule in part of the gluten chain called gliadin. This is why some naturally 'gluten free' things still cause reactions in celiacs. \n\nWheat has been around for a long time but not part of our diets for very long. In the short period which we've been cultivating it bread's only been around a short time, and the sloping dramatic increase in gluten in that bread even shorter. Additionally to all of this, we now eat **way more bread than we did before. There is wheat in almost everything.** It's difficult to feed 7 billion people every day and wheat is cheap and plentiful. Because of this it's used as a filler in just about every place it has no business being in, even further compounding the problem. \n\nBecause of this we are exposed to so more gluten (or rather gliadin) and in far higher concentrations than ever before. Many people don't realize it's causing other health problems and remain undiagnosed because there is no good difinitive test for it. This is why many gluten intolerant people are questioned. \n\nBackstory: I was iron deficient as a child despite eating very well and later discovered it was gluten that was messing up my digestion and causing the severe pain and indigestion I was experiencing my whole life. The symptoms hit everyone slightly differently. When I stopped eating gluten as a simple test directed by a British married couple who were doctors but moved here to practice alternative medicine instead, I said I'd try. Well it was the best few months of my life and i was virtuslly pain free. Every time I had gluten afterward without my knowledge because it's in literally everything, I flared up again and had to look back through what I ate to discover what had wheat hiding in it. My actual family doctor said the only available test was a gastronomy that tested binary (y/n) for celiac disease, which I already knew I didn't have because I didn't get anaphelactic(sp?) reactions like an allergy. She also told me the test has a 25% chance to return false negatives (ie comes up negative on confirmed celiac disease carriers), but was still more accurate than the blood test. I felt like I was living in a 3rd world county because we couldn't test for it but she said we were just starting to approach it in medical science so we don't really know much about it. Anyway the best part is that the gastronomy involves eating wheat every day for 2 weeks and then going in with a camera to survey the damage. I asked how the fuck someone was supposed to do that who had a wheat allergy and my doctor just kind of smiled and shrugged, as in that's what we're dealing with. I made it one day eating wheat before quitting the test and cancelling the gastronomy and my health has been awesome since. ",

        "224": "I will add to this comment, since I relate a lot to it. To clarify, I went to the doctor and we were never able to exactly identify the cause, if it was a gluten intolerance, allergy to wheat or yeast, or what, but we treated it like a gluten intolerance.\n\nAfter I came back from living in Korea for a year and a half, I began eating bread products like crazy again. I didn't eat much bread while in Korea (the bread there was very different), but I did have specific symptoms whenever I did eat bread occasionally, and when I drank alcohol. Before going to Korea I ate bread regularly, and was able to drink. \n\nWhen I came to Canada, I ate a lot of bread (but rarely drank- a bit on that later), and I developed weird symptoms that I have had before, but never made the connection. I'd get extremely tired/ exhausted, cramps, dizziness, vomiting, and fevers (never registering a temperature, but hot to touch). I had a couple of times when I was so sick I would just try to sleep off the symptoms. I went to the doctor and she advised me to monitor what I ate, but I kinda ignored that for a couple of months and just continued on. In January the symptoms got intense, and the pattern really started to emerge. I'd eat bread- get super sick (vomiting excessively- 13 times in one day on an empty stomach)- so I'd eat soup only (didn't feel like having any bread), recover, then start eating bread again then go through the same process of feeling sick again with the same symptoms.\n\nWent to the doctor again and she suggested it might be a gluten intolerance or something similar, and that it could be the drastic change in diet. One thing I should note though- I had some of these symptoms develop while in Korea when I drank alcohol. At first I could drink 3 soju bottles with no problem (think weaker vodka, size of a coolers bottle), but soon I developed these fevers and vomiting that would get me sick for at least 24 hours later, even after just having 1 shot, or just a bit of alcohol (I drank other things too). Coming back from Canada I found wine did the same thing to me, and I did experience the same thing when eating potato chips that had a large amount of yeast extract as part of the flavouring. So whatever it was, yeast or gluten specifically, it's really hard to really determine. All I can say- my symptoms of fevers and vomiting and feeling exhausted were very real and really affected me for a long time, just like a gluten intolerance rather than celiac (which would cause immediate symptoms, rather than a delayed appearance of symptoms).\n\nThe strategy the doctor came up with for me was to go gluten free and slowly try and reintroduce gluten products back into my diet while also taking a probiotic to heal my gut. It's been 4 months, and I've been able to have the occasional bread-thing about once a week without any symptoms, and even had a glass of wine recently and had  minimal symptoms (felt a bit feverish). \n\nFor me, I am tired of some people claiming that I was wrong for treating it as a gluten intolerance because it \"doesn't exist\", or jumping the gun and say I should go to a doctor to get a professional opinion when I asked about going gluten free. But my symptoms were severe and real, and like I said, although my doctor and I treated it as a gluten intolerance we weren't able to identify exactly what it was. But going gluten free helped, and I do find /u/p3tunia 's explanation of the microbiome really applied to my situation. If anything, even if you don't think gluten intolerance is a thing, at least it has been able to give celiacs and those with similar allergies a lot more options when it comes to gluten free products.

The outer parts are made of dead cells (keratinocytes) loaded with protein that keep them together. Separating the outer and inner parts is a lipid layer that gives the skin its hydrophobic/barrier properties - this is important so that the contaminated and electrolytically foreign outside water doesn't mix with your tissue/blood fluids and ruin its carefully maintained electrolyte/protein contents.\n\nMy guess for what could cause \"water allergy\" would be some kind of defect in these barrier functions, meaning outside water applied to the skin somehow penetrates the skin.

At age 12-13 she was having severe intestinal issues, chronic joint pain,  (couldn't keep up with her friends just walking around, etc), severe bloating...we were dumbfounded, so we started testing for everything (thyroid, diabetes, lyme, etc, literally everything the doctor could think of) her blood work came back positive for the Celiacs antibodies, so we had an endoscopy done and it came back with severe intestinal damage. It was scary as hell. \n\n\nThe GI Doc explained that it would repair itself if we cleared out Gluten, etc, (and it has) and that we had to get everyone in the family tested.

Peter was not trying to say that NCGS does not exist. He was interested in discovering if people with IBS were getting relief from the gluten free diet because they no longer ate gluten or if there was something else in wheat, rye and barley that made them ill.\n\n&gt;He specifically excluded people such as myself from the study, who have multiple illnesses. He focused only on IBS.\n\n&gt;What he found, in these 37 people, is that they were getting relief from the gluten free diet because they no longer ate the sugars in wheat, rye and barley. The diet did work for them, but it wasn't gluten making them sick. Because of this they can do even better on a more restrictive form of the gluten free diet, called the FODMAP diet. They still eat gluten free, but they also avoid a number of other gluten free foods that contain the same sugars as wheat, rye and barley.\n\n&gt;He stressed to my friend that this in no way said that NCGS did not exist. Gluten just wasn't the culprit in these 37 specially selected people.\n\n&gt;He also stressed that he has evidence that in these test subjects that gluten might have been making them depressed! He noted that more research is needed to be sure, but he suspects it may be the case.\n\n&gt;So you can see that a gluten free diet helped these people and a FODMAP diet helped them even more! That's all his study really said.\n\n&gt;---\n&gt;Megan sent him a video and he responded with this e-mail message:\n\n&gt;Dear Megan\nIn place of a video, I will address your queries by email.\n\n&gt;You are right in that our study has been misinterpreted and criticised presumably because the results did not fit preconceived ideas or was seen to support other ideas (like \u2018it is all in your head\u2019).\n\n&gt;The study was not designed to determine whether gut symptoms in the participants were real or not \u2013 the \u2018all-in-your-head\u2019 concept is way beyond its use-by date and has little credence these days. The study was about trying to identify what specific component of wheat might be triggering the symptoms. We looked directly at the protein content of wheat (mostly gluten) and indirectly at FODMAPs. We found in this small group of people who believed it was the gluten causing the problems that gluten was indeed not causing the gut symptoms, but in another report (I have copied it for you perusal) that gluten might be causing current feelings of depression. The latter finding needs confirmation. It all had nothing to do with determining whether the symptoms were real or not! We believe that the fructans (FODMAPs) in the wheat might be a more likely trigger of the gut symptoms as all participants had improved symptoms when they reduced the FODMAP intake (from all sources).\n\n&gt;So the bottom line from these studies is that gluten is unlikely to be the trigger of gut symptoms in the people studied, but that gluten might be making them feeling more depressed. This in no way means that gluten does not cause gut symptoms in people without coeliac disease \u2013 but just not in this 37. The implication is that gluten is not a common cause of gut symptoms as some people believe.\n",

        "366": "Most people who do not eat gluten are not actually allergic to it, by which I mean they do not have a histamine reaction. There are, however, many other factors which discourage it's consumption.\n\n1. Genetic modification. Over the past fifty years especially, we have bred wheat to have more and more of the glutenous protein because it's what makes pizza and other bread products so stretchy and delicious. Our bodies may be having trouble keeping up. This means our gut can't digest it as easily. \n\n2. Processing. White bread was a miracle once! But it lacks the fiber, fats, and nutrients that wheat originally had. Bad for you? Maybe. Good for you? No. Bread products are rarely fermented anymore, which was arguably the most important step in being able to eat flour. Gluten causes awful neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms for me, but I can eat homemade (truly fermented) wheat sourdough no problem.\n\n3. Overabundance. Gluten and various derivatives are used in almost every processed food, so our consumption levels are somewhat camouflaged. This also means that when you cut out gluten, you're also cutting out a lot of preservatives, sugars, and other fairly undesirable food products.\n\n4. Inflammation. Whether due to our inability to digest it or other reasons, gluten is known to cause inflammation, in levels that vary person to person. Inflammation in your gut reduce your body's ability to absorb nutrients. Whether or not you're allergic to gluten, reducing systemic inflammation by not eating can have benefits in a wide variety of disorders, from MS to schizophrenia to Krohns and beyond.\n\n5. Chemicals. In America at least, many farms douse their fields in RoundUp just before harvest because it increases yield. That means the wheat is full of heavy chemicals. For Americans at least, we may not be allergic to wheat, but heavy chemicals can still mess you up pretty badly.\n\n(Here)[https://www.google.com/amp/www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain/amp] is a New Yorker article that discusses many factors.",

I know, because a relative of mine who worked at the VA was part of the effort to dismiss it's effects. He was an MD and he certainly wasn't the sort to ignore data in service of a paycheck. But the data was not yet there. \n\nI still blame him because it was already clear that something was happening. Not having the data dosn't mean there is none; you need to go look.

Modern industrial grain mills are roller style mills that crush the kernel and hold back the germ. This style of mill has only been around in the last 100 years. Previously they were all stone mills that grind the flower down between two massive grooved discs. In this case the germ is ground down with the rest of the kernel. The germ is the 'whole wheat' bit that contains most of the enzymic content, lipids and a fair share of protein.\n\nAt a certain scale storage becomes a very complicated process. Managing a rotating stock of hundreds of thousands of pounds of flour is not easy, so there's some inevitable degredation involved at those scales.\n\nFinally the type of bread produced plays an enormous role. Handmade bread (especially sourdough) ferments the flour via commercial yeasts in combination with airborne yeasts and yeasts provided by the baker via skin contact. These all work together to break down the glian  (gluen?) and gliadin in combination with water to form gluten bonds. It takes mechanical pressure *or* time for these bonds to be established and even more mechanical pressure *or* time for them to align and create strands of dough. \n\nMy own loaves of bread are sourdough from whole grain, unbleached wheat and ferment for roughly 2 days with very little mechanical interaction.

To clarify, while the increase may be exaggerated by people who falsely claim intolerance when they probably have other health issues (or are hypochondriacs), there is actually an increase in people with diagnosable gluten intolerance. And gluten intolerance is different than celiac. I'm taking here about gluten intolerance. Some possible causes include changes in the gut microbiome and changes in how we process and make bread.\n\nChanges in the gut microbiome are a likely cause/contributor but the causes and effects of that are just stating to be understood, and barely. So I won't go into that too much, but if anyone has questions I may be able to answer.\n\nOn the processing side, one interesting theory is that the germ of wheat helps us process the gluten in some way. It has lots of nutrients, vitamins, fats, etc. Modern wheat flour (even most whole grain stuff) is made by separating the germ from the rest of the wheat first, then processing. This causes the flour to keep longer but removes all those nutrients. This is why flour/cereals need to be fortified. However, we only fortify with the vitamins and minerals for which we notice obvious deficiencies. So it's entirely feasible that we are neglecting to add something back into the flour that helps SOME people not develop gluten intolerance. This may be via some immune response or due to changes caused in the gut microbe (e.g. we are no longer giving some micronutrients to a specific bacteria in our gut so it dies out.

Researchers initially attributed the growing number of cases to greater public awareness and better diagnoses. But neither can fully account for the leap since 1950. Murray and his colleagues at the Mayo Clinic discovered the increase almost by accident. Murray wanted to examine the long-term effects of undiagnosed celiac disease. To do that, he analyzed blood samples that had been taken from nine thousand Air Force recruits between 1948 and 1954. The researchers looked for antibodies to an enzyme called transglutaminase; they are a reliable marker for celiac disease. **Murray assumed that one per cent of the soldiers would test positive, matching the current celiac rate. Instead, the team found the antibodies in the blood of just two-tenths of one per cent of the soldiers.** Then they compared the results with samples taken recently from demographically similar groups of twenty- and seventy-year-old men. In both groups, the biochemical markers were present in about one per cent of the samples.\n\nThe whole article is interesting, and it's well reported (it's from the New Yorker, not some sketchy clickbait \"GlutenAlert365.com\" your aunt posts on Facebook).

They definitely get dibs, But it's also pretty lame to have insane back pain, cramps, headaches etc., and deal with people saying you're making it up :/ Like no, I don't eat pizza and doughnuts because I'm in it for the long con /s \ud83d\ude44 ",

        "82": "It's worth noting that many people can go with celiac their entire lives and not know. My grandmother was diagnosed in her 70s, only because other family members were testing positive.  She lived a very normal life with not too many health complications. Celiac is more likely to just shave some time off your life due to the damage it causes to the intestines and provide an array of minor inconveniences than kill you outright like say a peanut allergy.  This isn't the case for everybody of course, for some people who have abstained from gluten due to celiac for decades, any gluten at all can be deadly.  \n\nOne great thing about the hipster gluten free craze, is more and more people are thinking 'Well maybe I'm allergic' when they have an upset stomach after eating bread, and therefore get tested for celic.  I'd say this helps identify a lot of celiac patients whereas getting tested for celiac twenty years ago wouldn't have even been a thought.",

        "85": "I have two theories. Not everyone who is allergic to gluten isn't actually allergic to it. They might just think they are or they're trying to be cool. Also with the population so large you're going to see a lot more people with those \"rare\" conditions like 1:10,000 etc.",

        "89": "Is there any good scientific evidence that mild gluten intolerance actually exists? \n\nI recall an Australian study where a study group that *thought* they were eating gluten experienced symptoms even though they were in the gluten free group. This would suggest gluten isn't actually the problem.",
        "9": "&gt;There is zero evidence that either of those conditions are any more common today than they were a thousand years ago.\n\nActually, they did some testing on old blood samples and determined that the rate was about four times what it used to be over 50 years ago. That's still four times a very small number, but it is concerning.\n\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-07/mc-mcs062909.php",

There must be something different about the strain of wheat or the processing. One theory I've heard is that UK wheat is sprayed with something shortly before harvest to boost yields, and this is the culprit.\n\nImporting flour made from Italian wheat, and baking products from it would be a fantastic business opportunity.",
        "94": "Yeah, because I tried going gluten free before seeking the diagnosis and have been eating gf seriously for a while, I'd have to go back onto a gluten diet for 2 weeks to 2 months in order for the blood tests and endoscopy to show any results. And that whole time I'd have to put up with the pain and the bleeding and the rashes allover my skin and the crapping and the vomiting- but someone thinks that just because I don't want to go through that for a scrap of paper, that my gluten intolerance isn't real?  \n  \nTwice I've accidentally ate gluten/wheat products since going on a gluten-free diet, and both times were some of the worst non-lethal, prolonged misery that was preventable. It's just not worth it to me to feel like that again on purpose.",
