      "0": "We don't know. There are a number of theories about this. To clarify, while the increase may be exaggerated by people who falsely claim intolerance when they probably have other health issues (or are hypochondriacs), there is actually an increase in people with diagnosable gluten intolerance. And gluten intolerance is different than celiac. I'm taking here about gluten intolerance. Some possible causes include changes in the gut microbiome and changes in how we process and make bread.\n\nChanges in the gut microbiome are a likely cause/contributor but the causes and effects of that are just stating to be understood, and barely. So I won't go into that too much, but if anyone has questions I may be able to answer.\n\nOn the processing side, one interesting theory is that the germ of wheat helps us process the gluten in some way. It has lots of nutrients, vitamins, fats, etc. Modern wheat flour (even most whole grain stuff) is made by separating the germ from the rest of the wheat first, then processing. This causes the flour to keep longer but removes all those nutrients. This is why flour/cereals need to be fortified. However, we only fortify with the vitamins and minerals for which we notice obvious deficiencies. So it's entirely feasible that we are neglecting to add something back into the flour that helps SOME people not develop gluten intolerance. This may be via some immune response or due to changes caused in the gut microbe (e.g. we are no longer giving some micronutrients to a specific bacteria in our gut so it dies out. That bacteria helped us process gluten or a byproduct and without its help we get sick). It's also possible that our body just needs some nutrient in the germ to process gluten efficiently. We really just don't know.\n\nTldr: shits complicated literally\n\nedit: First, I know the difference between a theory and hypothesis. I was using the term colloquially, which *even scientists* do sometimes.\n\nPeople seem to have extrapolated way more than they should have from my comment. Like are asking me where to buy bread with wheat germ and how to fix their gut microbes. That's really not how this works. Anybody who gives you an easy answer to your problems is probably trying to sell you something (I'm looking at you, supplement/probiotics industry...). \n\nUntil relatively recently we didn't even know bacteria could survive in your gut, so expecting the scientific community to have a solid understanding of the gut microbiome now is absurd. These questions span the fields of nutrition, microbial ecology, microbe-host interactions, immunology, and more. I'm sure there are hundreds of plausible explanations, but we are VERY FAR AWAY from definitively answering most questions related to the gut microbe. We DO know that it affects digestive health, mood, weight, and all kinds of other human physiology. What we don't know is how to bend it to our will or how it causes all of these things. We do know that the answer is complicated. How do different bacteria interact with each other in your gut, and then with your body? We also don't know much about that. But we're learning.\n\nThere is a unique soup of maybe 1000 species of bacteria in your gut, and they are mostly different than the species that live in mine. We are just starting to learn how specific individual species of bacteria can affect their hosts. But even with this research, we don't think that it will be the same in everyone.\n\nexample: Maybe bacteria A has effect B on me, but it has effect C on you, because I have bacteria Q in my gut and you don't, and bacteria Q is necessary for effect B. Now consider that x 1000 species, and that a genetic component also affects this, and diet and stress levels and fitness also affect this. See where I'm going?\n\nWe do know that the gut microbe is influenced by stress, diet, sleep, environmental exposure, your parents, exercise, infection, travel, antibiotics, alcohol consumption, genetics, epigenetics (which is affected by all of these things and more), social habits, sun exposure, etc. Just to name a few. The extent to which these affect each person is probably highly variable. So asking about specific solutions or a quick fix is a waste of time, especially on the internet. And if you have a shitty diet - especially one high in carbs and sugar - or high stress levels, or you drink a lot, addressing those first is probably a smarter solution than asking about wheat germ and special bread and probiotics (may work in some cases for some people sometimes, and usually not as a \"fix\" but as a supplement. it's just not well studied enough.) and GMOs (no evidence of them affecting any of this or even a feasible mechanism for how they would). \n\ntldr2: no really, shit's complicated. Something that works for one person may not for another for hundreds of reasons that we don't know much about yet, but are sort-of on the verge of understanding.

Ideally this would remove the need for the army to overthrow the president, because the other parts of our government (legislature and judiciary) could handle it. The problem with the armed forces doing it is that a.) it's not a peaceful transfer of power, and b.) the armed forces are now in charge of the government, which is bad.\n\nHaving the military swear to the Constitution also serves another purpose, which is to separate them from the president, even though he's the commander in chief.

If a company makes one million dollars, but spends 500,000 on investing in new technology for their product or something like that, they're only taxed from the remaining 500,000 because that's all of their \"profit.\" (I'm not a businessman so I'm not sure on the complete legality of all the kinds of spending but I think this is a basic summary). This is all normal and fine; all companies require investing in order to grow their company.\n \nSo a company in Panama basically made a business in creating fake businesses. Companies could \"invest\" million of dollars and then it wouldn't be taxed, because according to legal documents it isn't profit, it's an \"investment,\" which is untaxable, and then they would get their money back from the fake business. So imagine if that $500,000 of investments from my above example was fake, and after awhile 90% of the money was given back to the business (I'm assuming the Panamian company took a cut of the money as payment).  2.6 TB of data in total, over 11 million documents and over 200,000 fake companies. According to [the website that published the news of the leak](http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/56febff0a1bb8d3c3495adf4/), they were contacted by an anonymous source with encrypted files with the data sometime in 2015. Here's am exerpt from the article:\n> Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.\n  \nApparently there's several trillion dollars of money that should've been taxed and wasnt. Not sure if that means trillions that should've been taxed off of, or trillions of dollars of straight tax money, but either way it's a LOT.\n \nMany political leaders (many seem to be in the Middle East), and celebrities are involved as well. To prevent any one person from being blamed for the leak, hundreds of news organizations are going to release further full details tonight (that's what Ive heard, not sure how true it is) but the list apparently has thousands of people/companies on it. There's 11 million documents though, and even though hundreds of journalists have been going through the data for months, there's still information that has yet to come to light.\n\nThis goes much farther than tax evasion, and includes Syrian war crimes, human trafficking, and more.

      "15": "Most of these comments are probably wrong. Depending on what's in your freezer exactly, and when it was put in there, it shouldn't have viable preexisting eggs or larvae.\n\nThe blast-freezing process brings things to a temperature that kills most fly eggs, basically absolutely any that you're going to encounter. And without the blast freezing process, eggs on the surface of food (which is where most flies lay their eggs) will become nonviable in just a few days, max. If frozen slowly, the water in the egg will crystalize and rupture the egg.\n\nEverything you buy in the freezer isle is blast frozen (Edit: OK, *Almost* everything). All meat that you buy with the exception of fresh-shellfish is most likely going to be egg free. And shellfish-bourne eggs don't turn in to flies, they turn into worms and other parasites. Flies generally don't lay eggs on unripe fruit. They lay eggs on wet stuff. There are exceptions, like the fig wasp, that inject eggs. But these insects need more unripe fruit to successfully have multiple generations, which wouldn't be the case here. I'm guessing OP is dealing with some sort of blowfly larva like the common house-fly.\n\nFlies are very good at detecting the chemicals released as food spoils. As food spoils, it \"outgasses\". Solids and liquids are transformed by microorganisms into gasses. These gasses take up a much greater volume than the liquid and solid precursors. This puts pressure on the magnetically sealed door. This causes your freezer to begin to \"burp\" out these fly friendly gasses. Depending on the setup, there's a decent chance that the door will open and remain open. Regardless, fly noses act like leak-detectors on your fridge. They will find small cracks, and they will gleefully sneak through failed U-traps. Food in ziplock-bags will liquify, burst, and spill all over the freezer floor, weakening the magnetic seals, and luring flies to lay eggs right on the seal, allowing larvae to crawl in the direction of the scent.\n\nA couple years back, I had a fruit-fly infestation that got rather bad.  My freezer was new and in good working order. Fruit flies *obviously* are not going to be able to breed inside. But they are able to crawl inside, freeze, and die.\n\nIn my case, fruit-flies were likely going in the ice-dispenser, because that's where the largest collection of them were found. It has an inner funnel that is pushed up against the ice reservoir to work. They were trapped in that cold funnel region. The flap-gate on the ice-dispenser is not nearly as strong of a seal as the door seal. If you have an ice-dispenser, that's likely how they got in.\n\nThe only way it would be brought-in fly eggs would be if you froze some leftovers that a fly had time to lay eggs upon (this only takes seconds) and you did that like the same day the freezer failed.",
      "16": "Hi! I'm actually an estimator for a large electrical contractor, so I think I can comment on this pretty accurately. \n\nIn large cities you're correct, there's a reason you don't see power lines draped across buildings in Manhattan. And even more affluent neighborhoods will have the lines buried. But there's one enormous reason that ALL lines aren't buried: cost.\n\nNow this answer had been given, but there's some details you might find interesting. \n\nThe first is initial installation. Most underground cable at distribution voltage (4kV to about 35kV but that definition fluctuates) is installed in buried conduit, and basically every construction company can tell you that digging sucks. Even with a geotechnical report, some areas of the country are a total crapshoot as to what you'll find 3' down. In parts of VA it might be the water table, in parts of ID it might be lava rock. Usually the ground is either too soft and the hole/ trench doesn't hold up, or too hard and it takes forever to dig. Either way that means money. \n\nDigging also isn't very pretty, and most places have lots of rules regarding how you dig, when you dig, what you do with the spoils (dirt you dig up) and what you have to do to clean up afterwards. If you dig in the middle of nowhere this isn't bad, but God forbid you're in the rich part of town. Then on top of all this money you spent following the rules you now have to spend another big pile fixing landscaping (ya know that bush you dug up? The fourth one from the end that was almost dead? Yea, that was my great great grandmother's golden bush of infinite happiness! You owe me $5000 for it! No an almost identical bush isn't good enough!).\n\nNot too mention underground conductor is more expensive. The conduit it goes into is an added cost, but it pales in comparison to the price difference between underground wire and what you'd spend on overhead wire for a similar amount of current. Additionally this wire has to hold voltage that is desperately trying to release itself into the surrounding earth, so if you nick it when pulling it in, or damage the insulating jacket in some other way, congratulations you get to pull that wire in again! Because that electricity will arc that gap and the line won't work. \n\nIf that happens later on down the road, it's also much more difficult to diagnose and fix. With an overhead line, you can usually tell what's wrong (hint: what parts that should be in the air are now on the ground?) But with underground lines you have to drag out the thumper. \n\nThe thumper is a piece of equipment that applies a voltage to a line. The voltage goes higher and higher until it arcs through damaged insulation and makes a thump sound underground. Then a worker has to locate the fault (damaged piece of line) by walking the route of the line and listening for the thump. Now newer equipment is fancy enough to help you get pretty close without much work, but there's still a lot of experience and good luck to finding the fault quickly. By the time you add in the cost of the thumper, the crew's time to actually dig up and fix the line, and the outage time for the customers being fed, you're taking a pretty penny. \n\nNot to mention, mother earth is not kind. If you go to more remote places you can find lines that have been around 60 or 70 years. Not going to find many underground lines that old. \n\nThere's also the fact that adding capacity to overhead lines is easier in most cases, but that's a bit too nuanced for this post.\n\nAnd finally, electricity is pretty easy to move overhead. Water, oil, gas, and sewage are not. In most places the ground where it would make sense to bury power lines is *crowded* and most of those companies don't want high voltage anywhere near their stuff. Hell they don't even want the pole in the ground because most of the poles are grounded. But any company that will even let you bury near them is going to, at minimum, want an inspector on site while you build, and you get to pay his wages while he's out there. Most companies would rather take you to court than let you build though. \n\nSo most of the time, high lines are where it's at!\n\nEdit: All of my experience is in North America. I don't know why Europe manages to get everything underground, but as I mention below I expect its a combination of denser urban areas and government regulation. Some places in the US are experimenting with that, but others probably won't for quite some time.\n\n/u/thekbob linked a great study here: http://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/electricreliability/undergrounding/Pages/default.aspx \n\nThat goes a lot more in depth about why underground electric utilities are better at some things, and still unlikely to catch on in the states.\n\nAlso, I may have given enough information for some really dedicated soul to deduce who I work for.

Simplest medical device there is.  There's a number of ways to make it totally(ish) sterile- gases, steam, dry heat, gamma radiation.  \n\nBut as you ask- the little bacterial corpses are still *there*.  Waiting, one presumes, for tiny necromancers. \n\nThe problem occurs when you stab someone with the scalpel, preferably in a medicinal way. The bodies immune system works by identifying certain chemical triggers in bacteria, and has no way to know that, for example, the lipopolysaccharide hanging around in someone's heart is not part of a bunch of living bacteria, but the floating corpses of dead bacteria.  \n\nThe dead byproducts of bacteria are called \"pyrogens\" because they cause (among other things, such as death) fevers.\n\nWhere do they go?  Nowhere.  Bacteria are small enough that water has completely different properties on their level.  Beyond rinsing off gross matter and reducing bacterial load, washing can't do much.  \n\nSo for things like heart surgery scalpels, there will usually be a second step of \"Depyrogenation\"  This is the process, not of killing bacteria, but of removing the bits left behind so they don't trigger an immune reaction. This varies widely in complexity depending on what you have to depyrogenate- steel scalpels are easier than an injectable drug, for example.  Typically, the goal of the process is to so thoroughly break down the biological material left behind. \n\n*ok dang,  Fiddling with this post to answer some common questions*  There will be more of the apparently popular TimeNotTheMiles Humor, plz don't turn on me like wild dogs k thnx.\n\n\n**My post on how Depyrogenation can be done**\n[here](https://m.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5640rc/eli5_if_bacteria_die_from_for_example_boiled/d8g6ctk)\n\n**General Note:  Endo and Exotoxins are types of Pyrogens** \n\n*For more detail go [here](https://m.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5640rc/eli5_if_bacteria_die_from_for_example_boiled/d8g9z8v) where u/aliteralmarshmallow u/Saint_Gainz u/checkhorsebattery and u/Chapped_Assets go into detail about endo and exotoxins using incredibly inappropriate words for five year olds- like \"lysed\", and \"amebcytes\"*\n\n*Keeping on Chooglin'!* \n\n**Why not make instruments out of antibacterial materials?  Or 3D print them?**\n\nIf its a metal, you can just heat it.  From a strictly technical standpoint, thermal heat is not the most efficient way to destroy the dead remnants of bacteria, but from a cost effective standpoint, it's really cheap. So you might as well use steel.  If its a liquid, the issue isn't sterility-sterile is dead germs.  Depyrogenation is cleaning up the germ corpses and the deathjuices they spit out in their hate.  Where it gets technically tricky is working with things like drugs or implantable substances.  IE- stuff that you can't just put in an oven.\n\n**Quick run down on terms**:\n\n*\"Cleaning\"* a medical device is basically doing dishes-getting blood n bits off the reusable ones.

They're covered in happy, healthy bacteria.  \n\n**Then why wash my hands??  I would like to be filthy, but society....**\n\nWashing your hands removes dirt and debris that carry the nastiest bacteria.  Sterilizing your hands is a ridiculous notion however- your hands are made of cells, bacteria are made of cells.  Anything that would kill them would kill your cells. Your hands, and literally everything else on the world not currently under direct gamma radiation bombardment, are covered in bacteria.  \n\n**Does that mean the Incredible Hulk generates a sterile field?**\n\nCouldn't say for sure, but you get to collect the skin swabs. \n\n**Am I eating Pyrogens?  Will I die?  Tell....tell Amy I always loved her.**\n\nPyrogens aren't much of a concern for eating. Your mouth is filled with bacteria, so is your digestive tract, so is your skin, so is everyone you love, so is the air EVERYTHING IS COVERED IN GERMS AHH AHH AHH\n\nBasically,your entire body is covered in and filled with teeming hordes of bacteria trying desperately to eat you alive, so your body is used to dealing with it.  Pyrogen reactions are a concern when you put dead-germ bits into places that don't have germs- blood, pleural cavity, brainbox...\n\nThink of your immune systems reaction this way:  You walk into your living room and find a DEAD BODY.  Is it going to hurt you?  No.  Do you freak out anyway?  Yes.  \n\n(Also your wife is named Mary, I'm deeply ashamed of you, *think about your life.*)\n\n**THE EXCEPTIONS** are things like E. Coli, Salmonella (\"I barely know Ella!\") and botulism.  In that case, what makes you poo/die is the toxins left behind by the bacteria.  So if you have a piece of rotting meat, you can't just cook it until it is safe, because the toxins are what get you, not the live bacteria. However, boiling CLEAN water (**NOT AN EXPERT ON POTABLE WATER BRAH DRINK AT YOUR OWN RISK** makes it safe to drink because its unlikely (in clean water) that there will be enough toxins (in clean water) to hurt you (drinking clean water well boiled.)\n\n**Um, reusable medical devices??  Like, Grody to the max + 1 4EVA.**\n\nIt depends.  A lot (**LOT**) of effort goes into making reusable devices safe.  A lot of reusable devices have limited re-usability. For example, you *may* be able to reprocess a scalpel a time or two, but eventually, that edge will start to fade, and the surgeon isn't going to whip out a whetstone mid surgery, are you kidding me it's not the civil war.  \n\nThere are, however, serious issues issues with reusing non-reusable medical devices, particularly things like lumens, catheters, shavers, and it gets gross.  It gets really, really, REALLY gross [you don't want to read this but you will anyway and it will haunt you, welcome to my life](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/02/22/8207/filthy-surgical-instruments-hidden-threat-americas-operating-rooms)\n\n**One word.

So, a lot of people have mentioned attenuation (signal degradation) as well as background cosmic waves.\n\nThe waves would very much weaken, but it can travel a long wave before its degrades to a unreadable state. Voyager being able to recieve a signal so far out is proof that's its possible. Im sure someone who has a background in radiowaves will come along and explain (I'm only a small-time pilot, so my knowledge of waves is limited to terrestrial navigation).\n\nAs to cosmic background radiation, credit to lazydog at the bottom of the page, I'll repost his comment\n\n>Basically, it's like this: we take two giant receiver antennas. We point one directly at Voyager, and one just a fraction of a degree off. Both receivers get all of the noise from that area of the sky, but only the first gets Voyager's signal as well. If you subtract the noise signal from the noise + Voyager signal, what you've got left is just the Voyager signal. This methodology is combined with a lot of fancy error correction coding to eliminate reception errors, and the net effect is the pinnacle of communications technology: the ability to communicate with a tiny craft billions of miles away.",

The cell phone type gets hurt at 100% charge and the cordless house phone type lasts longer at 100%, plus the house phone type is much cheaper and easier to replace (so even if it doesn’t last super long, it’s not a big deal).\n\nEdit2:\nELI20 now features more ELI20-like-explanations In parentheses.\n\n\nI've worked in the battery biz for 10 years.\n\nMost commercial li-ion batteries don't handle high state of charge (battery % shown on your device) very well as the oxidation rate (how fast the liquid inside is getting used up) of the electrolyte is high at this state, so you lose lithium ions rapidly (battery can’t store as much charge.)  This causes loss of capacity (runtime).  \n\nThe internal resistance (resistance is the phenomenon that reduces battery power) of the battery goes up at the same time, and it can't charge/discharge as quickly anymore, so the end effect is it can't perform well in the device (the device needs a certain amount of power, which the battery will eventually struggle to deliver) and this actually accelerates the capacity fade even more. (Battery loss of runtime will get worse each day)\n\nMost household phones are Ni-MH chemistry which is much lower energy density (heavier and less sexy) but handles high state of charge much better.  \n\nThey used to put Ni-MH in cell phones in the mid-to-late 90s, they were big, bulky, and didn't have a lot of talk time.   Li-ion was better in every way for cell phones.  For household phones this isn't really a problem, and Ni-MH is much cheaper to implement, plus they are more easily customer replaceable (they don’t catch on fire, and are widely available)\n\nYou can get a much longer lifetime out of lithium-ion batteries by implementing lower maximum voltage, for example 4.1V max charging voltage instead of 4.2V.  This is called derating and is used in more high-end applications like Teslas (4.1V is normal charging mode, 4.2V is \"extended range\" mode which you shouldn't use if you don't have to).\n\n\n\"Regular\" lithium-ion batteries are usually charged to 4.2V and the device makers don't give a shit about the long term longevity, they just want to advertise longer runtime on a single charge at beginning of life.",
      "33": "First of all, let's talk about the words 'uppercase' and 'lowercase'. These words come from the early history of printing, when a person called a *typesetter* would assemble each page of a book letter by letter. Each letter was a profile on a piece of lead, called a *sort*. The sorts were kept in boxes called [*typecases*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting#/media/File:Metal_movable_type.jpg), which had compartments for each letter. There would be a typecase for each *font* (also called a *fount*), which was a *typeface* at a specific size, at a specific weight (bold, medium, *etc.*), in a specific shape (upright, italic, *etc.*). A typeface is what we nowadays call a font on computers. There were actually two typecases for each font, and they were kept one on top of the other. The one on top was called the *upper case*, and contained the 'majuscule' letters; the one on the bottom was called the *lower case*, and contained the 'minuscule' letters. So the proper names for 'uppercase' and 'lowercase' are 'majuscule' and 'minuscule', respectively.\n\nNow, on to your actual question.\n\nLetters are just simple drawings that have phonetic meanings. (In other words, the symbols represent sounds.) The nature of the symbols is affected by the thing the symbols are written on. For example, one of the earliest writing symbols we have is [cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform#/media/File:Early_writing_tablet_recording_the_allocation_of_beer.jpg), which was written by making marks with a stylus in a piece of clay. The shape of cuneiform marks is strongly determined by the shape of the stylus.\n\nThis is important, because the majuscules and minuscules were originally two forms of the Latin alphabet that were used for writing on different materials, and the same thing applies to the Greek alphabet.\n\nMajuscule letters were originally *inscriptional*, which means they were carved into stone. The Roman emperor Trajan had his military victories depicted on a carved stone column called [Trajan's column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Column); at the base of this column is some writing, in the style of [Roman square capitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_square_capitals): this style is common on Roman monuments, but Trajan's column is one of the best known examples. These letters were designed by a scribe painting them on to the stone with a brush; a stonemason would then carve out the painted areas. The motion of the brush created little flairs at the beginning at end of each brush stroke; these flairs are now known as *serifs*.\n\nHowever, Romans writing out documents would use [Roman cursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_cursive). Roman cursive, like all cursive writing forms, is basically a bunch of shortcuts in writing the 'proper' letters.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Roman culture continued to hold considerable sway amongst the barbarians. The same writing styles were preserved, until the Carolingian Renaissance under Charlemagne (Charles the Great) in the Frankish Empire (now France) in the 800s. Charlemagne was a great believer in literacy, and despite never learning to read himself, ordered the creation of a single style of handwriting to be used across his empire, to prevent documents from being misinterpreted. The end result was a pairing of these two writing styles into the majuscule and minuscule letters of a unified alphabet. The minuscule letters, being easier to write quickly, were use normally, but the majuscule letters, with their grand and elegant forms, were used for proper nouns and emphasis. Over the succeeding thousand years, different nations would slowly adapt these letter forms and the relationships between them to their needs: the Italians developed the [Humanist minuscule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanist_minuscule), which later became the italic script; the Germanic peoples developed the [blackletter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter) scripts; the Irish developed the [insular script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_script). This development continues today, with hundreds of typefaces released each year by type designers.",

You can think of your brain as a bunch of locked boxes with different things inside of them. Some of these boxes have things that make you happy, others make you sad. Some have things that tell you it is time to go to sleep. Caffeine jams itself into the lock on the sleepy time box so that your brain can't open it. That keeps you from feeling tired. \n\nCaffeine also can help open the box that tells your body to go into extra energy mode. Things like your heart can work faster or slower depending on what you need. If you are sitting on the couch watching TV it's going to go slower, if you are outside working it's going to speed up. Caffeine tricks the body into thinking it needs to go into extra energy mode. Caffine doesn't create this energy, the body is just using what it has stored more quickly.

      "37": "The limbic system is responsible for this feeling! The limbic system is the emotion and memory part of your brain, and is hugely important for how you experience and perceive things. The limbic system has a direct impact on the autonomic nervous system. If you perceive that you're in a calm situation, your limbic system will impact the rest of your brain, and thus the rest of your body, to make your body act as if it's in a calm situation. The hypothalamus is also part of the limbic system and plays a role in your body maintaining chemical balances. It is also a reason why you feel physically ill.\n\nTo give a little bit more detail on a few things: \n\nThe sympathetic portion of the autonomic nervous system is the the part of your body that makes your heart beat faster, makes you breathe faster, makes your pupils dilate, makes you sweat, and makes you stop digesting food (your blood is diverted to your muscles so you can run if needed). It is the fight of flight response in your body and has a cascade effect on the rest of your body. If your limbic system is going crazy with emotional trauma, it'll make your sympathetic nervous system ramp up as well. If you just ate and your body all of the sudden stops digesting food, you may throw up.\n\nThe limbic system (emotion and memory area of the brain) also directly impacts almost every other part of your brain. The limbic system is smack dab in the center of your brain, thus connects to everything. This is why being in a really intense situation can change how you feel physically and how you even perceive (time slowing down) a situation. One of the important parts of the limbic system is the hypothalamus. \n\nThe hypothalamus plays a huge role in maintaining your body's \"natural state\". If you need food, your hypothalamus is the part that makes you feel hungry. The hypothalamus is part of the limbic system, so it is under these same controls of emotion. Under a really stressful situation, your hypothalamus will react with the release of cortisol, which will affect your blood sugar and can make you feel sick.\n\nNow, all of this kind of paints the limbic system as the bad guy, but that's not really true. The limbic system is also what integrates emotion into what we experience when something is positive. It's why your mom's cooking tastes better if you have fond memories of her. It's what makes your heart flutter when you're in love. It's what makes you remember things. Heck, it is even the reason why a truck horn can go off in the dead of night and you won't wake up, but when someone whispers your name you will.\n\nEdit: /u/dr_bewbz goes into the same thing in her response but with more focus on the autonomic nervous system.

      "39": "Many answers here are tackling how attackers use leaks and phishing to accomplish this, but I do want to highlight one frequently used brute force method:\n\nThere is a very common attack vector called “password spraying”, which essentially uses a set of common passwords (iloveyou, password123) generic to everyone and/or personalised ones (firstname123, email alias, phone number, etc.) to see what accounts they could get into. \n\nThe key is that you can set up password attempt limiting in two ways -\n* absolute attempts: no matter who is trying to sign into an account, lock it up after x attempts. This means that if you tried to sign into your account with a wrong password from your phone twice, then from your laptop once, it would lock you out of your account. Many high security financial apps have this.\n* relative attempts: they lock your device out, but not the whole account. Websites use information about your device (e.g. from your cookie), session, IP, etc. and just lock you out from that attempt. While this works against manual hack attempts, like your boyfriend trying to log into your messenger account, it doesn’t protect much against automated hackers. All a hacker has to do is reset their proxy to a new location, clear their cookies (both of which can be automated in a matter of milliseconds), and try another set of passwords as part of a new attempt. Most social media accounts that are optimised for access rather than security use versions of this, with varying levels strictness of how they define a new login attempt. \n\nBut in any case - use good, strong passwords. And don’t use the same one everywhere - some websites are incredibly easy to crack or reverse engineer so your security online becomes dependent on the weakest link.\n\n**edit: to add a bit more context on spraying, these attackers don’t typically try a bunch of passwords on a few accounts. Instead they try a limited set of common passwords on a bunch of accounts. It’s incredibly easy to buy dumps of registered email addresses - I’d bet that at least 3% of them have a super common password.",

      "45": "Alright here’s a very simple explanation. The placenta is what brings oxygen from mom to baby through baby’s umbilical cord (that’s where their belly button is) instead of through the lungs. When baby is inside mom, blood that has oxygen in it goes to the heart where it gets pumped out to the rest of the body. In you and me, there’s a little door that has a tunnel between the right side of the heart and the lungs. Our blood that needs oxygen goes through that tunnel to the lungs and then comes back through another tunnel to the left side of the heart, where it gets pumped out to the rest of the body. \n\nIn an unborn baby, the little door between the right side of the heart and lungs is closed and the pressure behind the door is very high. It’s too hard for blood to get through it, so it goes around through another secret little door to the left side of the heart. When a baby is born, there is a big shift in pressure behind that little door. When a baby takes its first breath, the secret little door slams shut. It’s kind of like when a door slams shut because of wind. When that secret little door slams shut, the pressure behind the door to the lungs gets lower, and that door gets unlocked. Now, the blood in the right side of the heart can go through that little door to the lungs where it picks up oxygen, goes to the left side of the heart, and then gets pumped through the rest of the body.\n\nWhen baby is inside mom, the lungs still get a little bit of blood to them, but they aren’t the primary place where gas exchange takes place (where oxygen and carbon dioxide move in and out). They’re working on growing and producing a slippery soap-like substance called surfactant. The surfactant helps keep tiny air sacs called alveoli open and from sticking shut. The alveoli are where gas exchange takes place, otherwise known as how oxygen and carbon dioxide move in and out of your body. When the baby is born, that pressure change and sudden blood volume to the lungs and alveoli causes gas exchange to happen, and that’s how baby now breathes and gets its oxygen.",

Someone in charge intentionally adds 10 defects.  Then they watch and see what comes through the line, what is discovered by the process.  If people only find 3 of the defects, then they can estimate they're catching 30% of the defects overall, letting 70% of the defects go through.  On the other hand, if all 10 defects are discovered, then they know they're catching all or nearly all of the defects.  The percentage of things they know about should roughly match the percentage of things they don't know about.\n\nIt applies to other statistics as well, like crime stats.  They can look at crimes they know happened but weren't reported through official channels, and look at crimes they know about and were reported. Looking at the difference shows about how many crimes go unreported.  It is not exact, but if people are careful about how they create the stats they can be fairly accurate. \n\nFor counting species there are several ways it can be done.  One way is like above, to have one group track the number of species in an area and another group figure out how many are new. Another method is a linear regression, figuring out an approximately how many species there should be based on estimates and comparing it to how many have actually been identified.\n\nAlso, most of the species that aren't discovered are small things.  We're down to small numbers of new birds and mammals, often they are sub-species that get reclassified as a new species, or they're highly specialized species living in a remote and small geographic area.  \n\nIt is mostly bugs, fungi, and other small organism that are being discovered in large numbers.

Therefore, he said he was against expanding the franchise to women.\n\nYou will find that many 19th century (and earlier) arguments around giving various rights to women often didn't center around their intellectual abilities, but around gender and household roles.

I.e if you were to take an Alexa outside and match it to the iPhone’s field of view, same framing etc, the thing that makes the Alexa look so sexy is the dynamic range.\n\nSecondly, a lot of people have mentioned ‘aspect ratio’. This is confusing;\n\nThe CinemaScope LOOK is far more important than just adding black bars over footage. You can see in my showreel that the whole thing is in 2.35 aspect ratio, but only a handful were actually anamorphic. I cropped everything to that ratio though to keep it consistent - and I guess it does add a cinematic illusion - but it is just essentially throwing away information and I wouldn’t really encourage it, even though I used to do it all the time.\n\nThirdly, for aspiring cinematographers and filmmakers; go out and shoot ! Practice, learn, and improvement will be an  inevitable byproduct..you need passion (as with anything) to continue with it, and grow. I am still very small time and ‘amateur’..I have a long ways to go.\n\nWatch. Be inspired, and develop your own creative flair.\n\nPs.

The blue ones are realllly good at this, which is why we see blue. The Tyndall effect is what best fits why eyes with low/no melanin are blue. Light enters, long wavelengths (aka non-blue wavelengths) are long enough to reach the back of the eye. The back of our eyes have the ability to absorb light. So basically all the long wavelengths get absorbed! However, blue is a SHORT wavelength and doesn't reach the back very well. It bounces around and ultimately gets reflected back out. That's why we see some people's eyes as blue. Remember, we see what is reflected, NOT absorbed. For example, a tomato appears red because it absorbed all other light wavelengths except red. The red wavelength is reflected - it's what we see. \n\nIt's actually pretty interesting, there's a laser that's still being approved that destroys the pigment in the iris to reveal blue eyes. Technically we all would have blue eyes if it weren't for pigment. Originally, everyone had brown eyes, blue eyes were a gene mutation that popped up after a while. \n\nBut what about grey eyes? They're...kinda blue, right? Well, there's an idea that this difference is due to some people having more collagen (just a type of building block for stuff like skin and tissue!) in their eyes than other people. This can affect the whole light reflection stuff and give variation. This, along with eye shape (the angle you reflect the light is involved in the 'clearness' of the color) could also explain why some people have eye colors that really kind of \"glow\" and \"pop\" while others with similar eye colors don't have very attention-drawing eyes. Ultimately, we still don't have a truly clear answer as to why some people have bright blue eyes while others might have blue eyes on the duller, grey side. They both have low levels of melanin in their eyes but there's a lot of other factors at play. \n\nNow getting back to the other colors. Really dark brown eyes have a lot of melanin. Sometimes they even look black, but if you took a light to them you would see that it's really just a deep brown color. More pigment = more absorbed wavelengths. So unlike blue eyes, light wavelengths coming in aren't really getting out. You're actually seeing melanin (that brown colored pigment mentioned earlier). Those with really high levels of it will have dark brown eyes, while those with more moderate amounts of it might have light brown eyes.\n\nOkay...but what about GREEN? There's a green pigment, right? \nWell, no. We need to look at what the differences and similarities to hazel and green eyes are to further understand. Hazel eyes involve having both the blue eye effects yet enough pigment to where the color seen isn't blue. So there's little enough melanin to still get some of those blue wavelengths to bounce around and get reflected out again, but there's enough melanin to where you're still seeing brown. Together, you get kind of a brownish green. There's a lot of variations of this of course - hazel eyes are going to look different from person to person due to amounts of melanin and those other possible factors we mentioned in the gray vs blue eyes. \n\nTrue green is actually quite rare. This is why: You have the same stuff as hazel eyes going on (low-ish melanin, blue light reflection) but you also have a decent amount of a different type of pigment called lipochrome. Lipochrome isn't found as often in humans as other mammals like dogs, cats, etc. Melanin is BROWN, but lipochrome is YELLOW. Low-ish amounts of melanin, plus a good amount of lipochrome is what gives people green eyes. The \"greenest\" looking eyes would likely be ones with very very small amounts of melanin, but moderate amounts of lipochrome. The more melanin mixed in, the more brown-green (closer to hazel) you get instead of blue-green. \n\nThose with a lot of lipochrome and melanin might have closer to amber-colored eyes. \n\nEven blue eyed people can have \"flecks of gold\" - this would likely be due to some bits of lipochrome in their eyes.\n\nOther animals like birds can have a wider, more vivid range of colors than humans because they actually have a wider variety of pigments in their eyes. You'll never see a human with the eye color of a great horned owl because we don't produce a yellow pigment in our eyes that vibrant and bold. Lipochrome's yellowness just doesn't compare to some of those bright yellow pigments birds have!\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!!\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the second gold!!

      "98": "Deep down in the bottom of your ear is a little drumskin. \n\nOn the other side of that drumskin is a little room about the size of a lima bean. \n\nOn the floor of that room is a little tunnel that leads to the back of your throat. That little tunnel opens occasionally to let fresh air in and flush out any moisture to the back of your throat. \n\nSometimes, when you're sick, the little tunnel swells up or gets blocked. Air can't get into that little room so a little vacuum forms. That vacuum sucks in the drumskin making it tighter than normal. When the drumskin tightens, it doesn't work the same and it makes sounds seem dull. \n\nWhen something opens that tunnel, like when you get over your sickness or you pop your ears, air comes back to the room. The air can come back in slowly, so you barely notice, or it can rush in and make a \"pop\". \n\nThe returning air relieves the drumskin and makes it easier to hear. If the problem with the tunnel isn't quite fixed, the vacuum and the \"pop\" might happen over and over until everything is fixed. \n\n**Bonus ELI-an-adult-redditor:** The eustachian tube (ET), which ventilates the middle ear space, may fail to function for a multitude of reasons. Often it's congestion of some type that temporarily blocks it or causes inflammation which impairs its function. Some individuals simply have dysfunctioning ETs and have chronic trouble equalizing middle ear pressure. In normal conditions, the ET opens frequently throughout the day before any significant pressure can build in the middle ear space. For this reason you don't really notice a change occur. When pressure has been allowed to change over time (e.g. in cases of cold or congestion) or pressure has changed suddenly (e.g. upon take-off or landing in an aircraft), a sudden opening of the ET is much more apparent and you get the classic \"pop\". If your congestion is ongoing, you get these prolonged periods of negative middle ear pressure with only brief moments of relief. \n\nMiddle ear immittance is a story for a different day. The short end of it as it relates to this thread is that the negative middle ear pressure sucks in the tympanic membrane (TM; ear drum), changing its frequency response and reducing its ability to transduce acoustic energy (sound). As the ET opens, pressure within the middle ear approaches that of the surrounding atmosphere, which is typically ideal for normal transduction of sound. \n\nEDIT: **Source:** I'm a **(EDIT: removed full credential to maintain anonymity)** audiologist, so I've spelled this out a few times in the past.

Bones contain calcium, phosphorus, sodium and other minerals, but mostly consist of the protein collagen. Collagen is a living, growing tissue that gives bones their a flexible framework that allows them to withstand pressure. Calcium fills in the space around that framework and makes the bone strong enough to support the body's weight.\n\nBut bones are still not as strong as teeth. The hardest part of the human body , teeth mostly consist of a calcified tissue called dentine. The tooth's dentine tissue is covered in enamel, that hard, shiny layer that you brush.\n\n\nThe exterior of bones consists of periosteum, a dense, smooth, slippery membrane that lines the outer surface of most bones , except at the joints of long bones, which instead consist of slimy hyaline cartilage. Periosteum contains osteoblasts, or cells that can manufacture new bone growth and repair.\n\nTooth enamel, unfortunately, doesn't have the same regenerative powers. Unlike bones, teeth cannot heal themselves or grow back together if they are broken. \n\nTlDR: Basically there arent any pathways or cells in your body designated to regrow the damaged enamel or dentine, unlike your bones which have multiple pathways to deliver cells and various cells in the body to regrow or fuse bones, despite both being made of very similar base components they are still very different structurally.\n\n(Not a dentist just Googled it)",

Roughly 2000 years ago, the Julian Calendar was established. 12 months, the same 30 and 31 (plus 28) day months, 7 day weeks, 365 day years. The astronomers at the time were precise enough that they knew a leap day was needed every 4 years to keep in sync.\n\nThat system was precise, but not precise enough. By the middle ages, a lot of places had undergone calendar drift, where the seasons no longer line up where they should.

In 1582, they said a particular day was Friday, the 15th of October. People generally had to skip forward 10 days, but it fixed the drift we already had. Now, leap years occur on years that are multiples of 4, but not multiples of 100, but being a multiple of 400 makes it a leap year again. 1700, 1800, 1900, not leap years. 2000, leap year.\n\nThat was one time a particular authority told everyone to sync up and they did.

      "109": "There's this thing called brute forcing. That's where you basically try 0000, 0001, 0002... etc. Typically, people would try the common passwords first, so 0000, 1111, 2222, 1234, 4321... etc, and then start trying every password, but that's besides the point.\n\nWhen you're using your bank pin, you have your physical bank card. And if you get the wrong pin too many times, that account gets locked out until you talk to the bank and get them to fix it. So somebody trying to guess your pin only gets 5/10,000 chances - and needs to actually physically have your card at that! After your card's been locked out, they can't do anything. Once you go to get it fixed, you'll get a new card and the one they have is rendered useless. They get 5 chances, total. And then they have to steal your card again, and have no guarantees that the five pins they guessed before are going to be wrong, since you could've (and should've) changed your pin!\n\nOnline accounts are quite a bit different. Sure, you may have forgotten your password somewhere and been locked out of your account for 10 minutes or whatever before. But that's not the only way people 'hack' online accounts. For that, we need to explain password hashing briefly.\n\n\nTypically, when you sign up for an account somewhere, your password will be 'hashed'. So if your Reddit password is `123456`, Reddit would only know it as something like `$2a$06$0JXJ7T//rMLelqOfaYYEw.cwQYivfp0KkJLcGaJwH/1kV8i5Oh3AS`. Meaning, if somebody hacks Reddit and gets the database of passwords, they still won't know what your password is. Even if they try and login using your hashed password, it'll just get hashed again, and Reddit will see it as something different. \n\nHashed passwords are also (kinda) impossible to reverse engineer. Regardless of what length password you put in, the hash will always be the same length. So multiple passwords can result in the same hash. Which does mean that it is possible to get from a hash to a password that results in that hash without brute force, you just can't get the original password. But not having the original password doesn't matter, as long as the password you have turns into the same hash. However; reverse engineering a hash like this is an incredibly difficult task, and grounds for a whole other ELI5 that I'm not qualified to write at all.\n\nAlright, so let's get back to the whole brute forcing thing. Once somebody has your hash, they're no longer bound by Reddit's wrong password limits. They can write a program that hashes passwords and checks it against your hashed password all they want. Once they get the right password, they only need to try and login once. Regular ol' computers can check millions of passwords per second - and more powerful computers built for this purpose can check in the tens of billions, or even higher. For a simple, short password it'll take a matter of seconds. Even for some of the more 'complex' passwords people think up, it's just a matter of days, maybe weeks. But not very long at all. Length is exponentially more important than symbols, blood of the first born, etc.\n\nAnd that's barely touched the surface of internet security.\n\n\n",
      "110": "There are several reasons relating to the varying use cases as others have described, but the main reason is this: Android uses a form of automatic memory management that uses garbage collection, while iOS uses a more manual form of memory management. Garbage collection works better if there is always a good chunk of memory free, so the garbage collector doesn't have to run so often.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)\n\nThe reason to use garbage collection is because it saves the programmer from manually having to managed memory. Memory management is tricky, and if you make a mistake, you might begin to leak memory (memory consumption goes up slowly) or create a security hole. Recent versions of iOS use something called automated reference counting, which means that the compiler (technically the pre-processor) will figure the correct memory management automatically. This means that the workload of managing memory moves from the phone to the computer of the developer that compiles the software.\n\nThe reason for this difference is historical. Android uses the Dalvik runtime, which borrows from Java, while iOS uses Objective-C and now Swift, which had a simple manual memory management system (manual reference counting). Apple used Objective-C because that is what they use in their own OS - Google used a Java analogue because it is a modern safe language that was widely by the time they launched Android, and so was easy for developers to learn.",

You get 144245. To get the original number back, just divide again by 10^4: 144245/10000. Since both the numerator and denominator are integers, the original number was rational. You can generalize this to show any decimal that ends is rational by multiplying and dividing by the appropriate power of 10 to ger rid of the decimal part.\n\nIf the decimal never ends, but repeats:\n\nSay x = 14.5124874874874...

When you draw on your arm in marker, the ink is carried from the tip to your skin by a solvent, like propyl alcohol, this solvent quickly dries. The solvent isn't water, so it penetrates more deeply into the keratinized layer of skin. This leaves the ink on the top of your skin, and a little will get INSIDE your skin (I'm talking in microns) this is why when you wash it off, most of it, the stuff on the surface, comes off fairly easily. It isn't water soluble, so you have to scrub and use soap, but it comes off. Then you always have a little left, the stuff INSIDE the very outside layer. Which you have to scrub hard to get off, you're mostly just scrubbing off that layer. \n\nFor blood, it can't get inside your skin, so it just dries on the surface.

Cotton will absorb water, so blood will absorb onto the thread just like ink. It will go into all the little nooks and crannies of the thread, and while red blood cells are bigger than the ink, they're small enough to get to the very inside of the thread. \n\nThen you try to wash the blood out, the red blood cells are inside that thread, they're trapped now, they flow in, but can't flow out. When you wash it, the red blood cells pop, leaving the red color behind, which is still trapped, stuck to individual cotton fibers now. \n\nThat's why you can wash out *some* of the blood, it's the blood on the surface of the thread, but you can't wash the blood that's on the inside of the thread. \n\n\nEdit: I avoided talking about prune fingers because it's contentious and irrelevant to this ELI5. \n\nPrune fingers are better at grabbing while underwater, but is it due to the absorption of a small amount of water on the exterior surface of your skin?

Or, you can take a cloth, and the cloth will absorb the blood. \n\nSo for this conversation, skin is waterproof. \n\nEdit 2: a couple people have mentioned that those with nerve damage don't get prune fingers, which supports skin being waterproof and that prune fingers are from a biological response. I haven't heard of this before, so I won't comment on it beyond saying that it's compelling proof. \n\nThat prune fingers is due to absorption of water by the skin was probably not something a scientist tested. It is a completely logical and sound thing for someone to assume, and even if skin is waterproof, that you *eventually* absorb *some* water is still reasonable. \n\nThese kinds of facts are very common, no one thinks to test them, there really isn't any reason to, until there is. That prune fingers is due to a biological response could be a very important fact for science, it can help teach us about localized responses, how local conditions are sensed, how the brain analyzes the information, and many other things. \n\nThis is why I question everything, if it hasn't been tested, then it is only a hypothesis, not a fact.

Basically all the books you study should be chosen based on some important theme in them - of Mice and Men is about the depression, Gatsby is about the Roaring Twenties and To Kill a Mockingbird is about racism and the Great Depression. This can inform the students about important context (especially Mockingbird) and a 'real connection' often makes books more attractive to study. \n\nThe other reason is that these books are easy to analyse. They are full of symbolism, foreshadowing and the historical context. Books like Frankenstein might be a dry read but it is a goldmine for analysis, and the deeper themes present (social commentary, (possible) homosexuality) means you can go to town on them. It is far easier to study that (and will benefit your skills more) than to go for something more enjoyable and (often) newer - which are often more readable but less deep (or restrictively long). \n\nOf Mice and Men is a really easy text to do analysis in, it's short and full of foreshadowing. Gatsby also has foreshadowing, but also themes of wealth, inequality etc. And some books can be 'read into' easily - that Nick is gay is not specific in the text but many student pick that up and believe it, it gives chances to develop skills simpler books don't have. \n\nThese make then qualify for the studying 'cannon', books like Gatsby and Of Mice and Men are chosen a lot because of the wealth of secondary literature on them, making critical opinion easy to find.

      "125": "Human cells don't replace themselves every 7 years.  Different cell types regenerate at different rates. \n\nI believe that muscle cells replace themselves once every 10 years at birth, but this declines rapidly as you age.  By the time you die, only about half of your muscle cells have been replaced.\n\nYour intestines are replaced every 4 days or so (the poor things). \n\n Your pancreas beta cells are replaced every 60 days or so.\n\nYour epidermal cells (outermost skin cells) are replaced every month.\n\nYour liver cells are replaced every year or so.\n\nFat cells are replaced at the 7-8 year cycle rate that the urban legend dictates.\n\n\nWhen you get a minor cut that does not puncture the entire epidermis, the injury will generally heal completely because there are epidermal cells underneath that grow outwards.  As the cells above are pushed upwards and outwards they will slough off revealing the newer epidermal cells beneath. The skin is as good as new after a month or so.\n\nHowever a deeper wound heals differently.  The wound fills with blood, platelets and clotting agents to form a clot.  Next fibroblasts are attracted to the wound site and begin producing collagen.  The epidermis then tries to cover the wound site with skin cells (this can only happen if the wound remains moist - if the wound dries out, the healing process slows immensely which is one of the main reasons why bandaging a wound is so important).  Scar tissue forms by filling the wound with collagen.  Once the wound has healed, the collagen remains.\n\nOver time, the collagen around the edge of the wound may slowly get replaced by neighboring cells, but if the wound is simply too large the regeneration of neighboring cells isn't fast enough to replace the nonfunctional tissue with functional cells.  Remember, the neighboring cells have to pull double duty.  In order for the scar to disappear, neighboring cells have to replace not only themselves but also their neighbors.  They can do this to a point, but it is ultimately limited.  So the body keeps the collagen in place which prevents the scar from disappearing entirely.  The scar isn't functional, but it is strong, tough tissue that holds itself together so its better than nothing.",

Hopefully everyone can follow along.\n\nSo to start with, we should note that  there are two forces that act on you: gravity pulling you down, and Earth under you, refusing to let you in and therefore pushing you up. A net result is, you stay roughly still.\n\nSo, to understand gravity better, lets erase Earth with its upward pulling, space-taking, ball-resembling properties and just leave the gravitational field. Basically, we make it so that you can freely fall through Earth unaffected by anything other than its gravity, to better understand gravity.\n\nNow, for you this would mean you start falling. But once you are at or near the center of Earth, it's not like you stop. Your momentum now keeps carrying you away from Earths core, and you emerge from the other side at about the same height as you started with, before gravity finally wins and manages to turn you around and make you fall back towards Earths core.\n\nSo when you think about path you trace, you notice it would resemble a line, or perhaps an ellipse if you started with sideways motion. And now to high school physics part of this, you notice that all you're doing is exchange gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy and back. Your total energy stays the same always.\n\nAnd this means, without using energy to change your trajectory, you could not reduce this total energy you have and stay, on average, closer to Earths core. You make flybys but cannot stop going away again. \n\nAnd you notice, for Moon these scenarios, with fall-through Earth and real Earth, are identical. Moon just keeps falling but has enough sideways motion that instead of huge yoyo motion, it does something more resembling circular orbit.\n\nAnd to go back to the example of you jumping, that can be seen as you adding a tiny extra bit of energy to your orbit.

      "145": "To understand this, you need to understand what a programming language actually does, and to understand that, you need to understand how computers work at a very basic level.\n\nAt a fundamental level, a computer consists of a block of *memory* where information is stored and a *processor* that does operations on that memory.\n\nImagine, for example, that we just wanted to have a processor that could do logical operations and store the result somewhere. We'd need to tell it which logical operation to do: let's say we just want AND, OR, NOT, and EXCLUSIVE OR (XOR for short). Computers talk in zeroes and ones, so we'll need a code composed of zeroes and ones to \"name\" them. Let's say 00 is NOT, 10 is OR, 01 is XOR, and 11 is AND.\n\nWe also need to tell it which two things to apply the operation to. We'll say we only have 16 slots in memory, each holding a zero or a one. We can, in turn, name these 16 slots using a 4-digit binary code, with 0000 for the first slot, 0001 for the second, 0010 for the third, 0011 for the fourth, and so on through 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, and 1111 (in order, the numbers 0 through 15 written in binary). The operations can have two inputs, so we'll need two of these 4-digit codes.\n\nFinally, we need one last four-digit code to tell it where to store the result.\n\nWe can now feed our processor a fourteen-digit list of zeroes and ones as an instruction, agreeing that the first two digits represent the operation we want to do, the next four indicate the first slot in memory we want to operate on, the next four indicate the second slot in memory we want to operate on, and the last four indicate where we want to put the result. \n\nFor example, the code 11111011000011 could be read as [11][1110][1100][0011] = [do the AND operation][with the first value being the digit stored in slot 1110 = slot 14 in memory][and the second value being the digit stored in slot 1100 = slot 12 in memory][then store the result in slot 0011 = slot 3 in memory].\n\nFundamentally, this is all computers ever do - everything else is just window dressing. Processors have a hard-wired list of some number of instructions - usually a few hundred, consisting of things like \"add thing at address A to thing at address B and store to address C\" - and everything else gets built on top of that.\n\n*(By the way, you might notice that this computer only has 16 slots of memory, but it takes 14 slots just to store an instruction! In the real world, the addresses are usually 64 digits long, and there are many trillions of possible addresses, so this is less of a problem!)*\n\n-----\n\nSo - what's a programming language? At its base, a programming language is just a way to make these instructions human-readable. To \"create\" a programming language, we just need to tell our computer how to translate the instructions we write into machine instructions like the 14 digit number we gave just above. For example, we might write AND(14, 12, 3) instead of 11111011000011.\n\nBefore this works, we need to write a *different* program that tells the computer how to translate AND(14, 12, 3) into 11111011000011. To do that, we just do everything by hand - we write out a program, using the numerical codes, to read the text symbols. But the core idea is that we only ever have to do this once. Once we've done it, we can then write every other program using this (somewhat) human-readable language. \"AND(14, 12, 3)\" is really ugly, but it's less ugly than 11111011000011. We call the program that translates human-readable language like AND(14, 12, 3) into machine code like 11111011000011 a *compiler*.\n\nThis first human-readable language, which is just words stuck on top of the actual instructions in the processor, is known as *assembly* language. It's still hard to read, because you have to turn everything into such simple operations, but it's a start. And we can repeat this process, by writing a program in assembly language to interpret something even more human-readable, possibly breaking down a single human-readable line of code into five or ten machine instructions.\n\nIn practice, most modern languages break down into existing languages that are closer to the 0's and 1's the processor uses (called *low-level* languages in programming parlance). For example, the Python programming language runs on top of a base written in C (another programming language), which in turn sits on top of your operating system, which in turn sits on top of assembly. Each layer in this hierarchy removes less direct control from the programmer, but also allows them to do things much more easily without worrying about the details of manipulating ones and zeroes.\n\nIf you wanted to make a new programming language (we'll call it Esperanto), you'd start with some existing language. Let's say you use C. You write a C program that reads text source code written in Esperanto, and translates the human-readable Esperanto text into C commands (or into machine code directly if you wanted). This is your compiler. Once you've done that, you can stop worrying about the C level at all! You can write your program in Esperanto, then run your C compiler program to translate it into C commands, and run them however you would run a C program. As long as you can say, in an existing language, what you want an Esperanto command to do, you can write it into your compiler and be on your way.",

As a matter of fact, they are hard to fake. People don’t really believe that the grinning flight attendant is happy to see them. That is because a social smile is formed with a different configuration of muscles from the genuine smile of pleasure. A social smile is executed by circuits in the cerebral cortex that are under voluntary control; a smile of pleasure is executed by circuits in the limbic system and other brain systems and is involuntary. Anger, fear, and sadness, too, recruit muscles that can’t be controlled voluntarily, and the genuine expressions are hard to fake, though we can pantomime an approximation. Actors must simulate facial expressions for a living, but many cannot avoid a mannered look. Some great actors, like Laurence Olivier, are highly coordinated athletes who have doggedly learned to control every muscle.

      "160": "This is really two different questions, so that's how I'm going to treat it. \n\n**First question: How do birds make human sounds when their bodies are so different?** \n\nThe answer is that birds rely on vocalizations, so they actually have a very diverse set of noises they can make. Birds sing and chirp and hoot to relay all kinds of information, the way we make different noises with our mouth to mean \"hello\" or \"danger\" etc. The [physiology of birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_\\(bird_anatomy\\)) allows them to make most of the same sounds as us--however, there are sounds that they can't make. [Listen closely to this](https://youtu.be/9y3VX8VU9kI?t=25s). The word \"pick\" actually comes out \"kick\", but because there's a subtitle and because pick makes more sense, your brain wants to hear pick. \n\nYou're right on the money with lips: the sounds birds have trouble making are the sounds that require lips. But they use substitutes that are close enough that we might not notice. For \"p\" you can substitute \"k\". For \"m\" you can substitute \"ŋ\" (the sound at the end of \"thing\"). Both of these sounds can be made without lips. Birds also tend to talk very very fast, which helps blur the words together enough that they sound right. \n\n**Second question: Why don't chimps have this ability?**\n\n[Chimpanzees communicate mainly by gestures and facial expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBFBbFcixRY). They do make noises, but they're not the most important part like they are for us. Chimps only have [four distinct noises](http://www.chimps-inc.org/chimpanzee-vocalizations/), \"grunts, barks, screams, and hoots\". The way they distinguish meaning from these is how loud they are and whether they're low or high pitched. So chimps don't need the phonetic range that a human or a bird has. They don't need their muscles to make the kind of complex sounds that humans use. Evolution made some changes to our anatomy that allow us to make a wide range of sounds, but chimps don't need that so they never developed it. \n\nIn addition, phonetic range is a very use-it-or-lose-it skill. [If a baby human is not made familiar with certain sounds, they will have a much harder time picking them up later in life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition#Sensitive_period). So even with the sounds a chimp might be physically capable of making, the chimp probably hasn't trained their muscles to make it and will struggle with it. \n\nBecause primates like chimps communicate through gesture, they have actually been very successful at learning sign language. But their voices are only used for grunting and hooting, so it takes a lot more work for them to use words. \n\n**TLDR: Birds normally communicate vocally, like we do. Chimps normally communicate through gesture. It's easier to teach birds how to make certain sounds and teach primates how to use sign language than the other way around. Also, birds make mistakes but our brains like to fix them.** \n\nEdit: I am young and dumb. I wrote this post during a break from studying for my finals. I expected maybe five people to read it.

It's built into one bank of the harbor access, and had plenty space for cannon to sink a ship attempting to access the harbor.  The fort doesn't stop unauthorized ships from sailing further away from Puerto Rico, but harbors are really important for trade (then and now) so the fort protected that.  \n\nLike San Juan's Castle del Morro, many other forts were built to control access to something important to travel (like a mountain pass or a point where a river might be easy to cross or a good well in dry country), the goal isn't to prevent all movement, it's to prevent access to a very important point (the mountains or rest of the river or your thirst can greatly reduce the other movement).",

In effect one branch of gov owns the others debt, obviously BoJ is going to be more lenient with the Gov than EU with Greece.\n\n\nWhy Greece is in trouble:\n\n- Its debt is at a high interest rate\n- Its debt is attached to a currency it has no control over, the **EURO**. If their debt was in Greek Drachma's (currency prior to euro), In an extreme and unlikely scenario,It could print out more money and pay off its debt (this would of course make it harder for them to raise money in the future, since investors will not trust them. This would also lead to inflation. It would also cause other stuff I am not qualified to ELI5 because of their complexity)\n\n\nNow, I'm pretty sure you're thinking: \"But isn't GDP the Wealth of a country? I mean, if I'm making 50k a year and I owe 50K in loans, aren't I better off than a guy who makes 100k a year but owes 300k?\"\n\nWell, unfortunately, GDP is an indicator of a Countries Wealth, **not its Governments Wealth**. Greece's government doesn't \"make\" the GDP, it makes what it can tax from the GDP, and then after it is done with government spending it can use what's left to start paying off debt. What's left is very little because of multiple factors, some of which but not all are:\n\nedit: to be clear\n\n\n- The Governments inability to get people to actually pay taxes (they're doing better than they used to).\n- The fact that raising taxes and/or cutting social programs **will** slow down the economy making it harder to make more money.     \n- Some social programs cannot feasibly be cut (e.i: the Greek version of social security) or risk destroying the country\n- Greece is not growing very fast for various complicated reasons (aging pop is one)\n\n**Edit:**\n\nTo use the example of :\n\n - **Guy A** that makes 50k a year and owes 50k \n - **Guy B** that makes 100k a year and owes 300k\n\nIf **Guy A** has expenses of 45k a year (rent,food,etc..), he will only have 5k left to pay off debt. \n\nIf **Guy B** on the other hand could have expenses of 60k a year and will have 40k a year to pay of his debt, making him better off than **Guy A**\n\n\nI'd like to add that Japan's huge debt is a big concern, but since they are able to afford their interest payments, they have lower interest payments, which makes their interest rates lower, which makes it easier to afford their interest payments, which....\n\nBecause I just had this argument with a friend I'm going to add something here:\nThe **BoJ** has the power to print more money to fulfill interest payments not the Japanese government. This means the BoJ could refuse to print money to pay debt obligations (in a worst case scenario), but in reality wouldn't because of the negative effects (i.e Japan defaulting).

      "164": "In the words of Robert Zubrin, head of the Mars society. \n\nQuestion: Could you go over the why for going to Mars? \n\nDr. Zubrin: As I see it, there are three reasons why Mars should be the goal of our space program: and in short, it’s because Mars is where the science is, it’s where the challenge is, and it’s where the future is.\n\n It’s where the science is because Mars was once a warm and wet planet, it had liquid water on its surface for more than a billion years, which was about 5 times as long as it took life to appear on Earth after there was liquid water on here, so if the theory is correct that life is a natural development from chemistry, where if you have liquid water, various elements and enough time, life should have appeared on Mars even if it subsequently went extinct, and if we can go to Mars and find fossils of past life, we would have proven that the development of life is a general phenomenon in the universe. Or if go to Mars and find plenty of evidence of past bodies of water but no evidence of fossils or the development of life, then we can say that the development of life from chemistry is not sort of a natural process that occurs with high probability but includes some freak chance and we could be alone in the universe. Furthermore if we can go to Mars and drill, because there’s liquid water underground on Mars, reach the ground water, there could be life there now. And if we can get hold of that and look at it and examine its biological structure and biochemistry we could find out if life as it exists on Mars is the same as Earth life because all Earth life at the biochemical level is the same—we all use the same amino acids, the same method of replicating and transmitting information, RNA and DNA, all that---is that what life has to be, or could life be very different from that? Are we what life is, or are we just one example drawn from a much vaster tapestry of possibilities? This is real science, this is fundamental questions that thinking men and women wondered about for thousands of years, the role of life in the universe. This is very different from going to the moon and dating craters in order to produce enough data to get a credible paper to publish in the journal of geophysical research and get tenure, okay? This is you know hypothesis driven, critical science. This is the real thing. \n\nSecond, the challenge. I think societies are like individuals, we grow when we challenge ourselves, we stagnate when we do not. A humans to Mars program would be tremendously bracing challenge for our society, it would be tremendously productive particularly amount youth. Humans to Mars program would say to every kid in school today, “Learn your science and you could be an explorer of a new world.” We’d get millions of scientists, engineers, and inventors, technological entrepreneurs, doctors, medical researchers out of that, and the intellectual capital from that would enormously benefit us. It would dwarf the cost of the program. \n\nAnd then finally, it’s the future. Mars is the closest planet that has on it all the resources needed to support life and therefore civilization. If we do what we can do in our time—we establish that little Plymouth rock settlement on Mars—then 500 years from now, there’ll be new branches of human civilization on Mars and I believe throughout nearby interstellar space, but you know, look: I ask any American what happened in 1492? They’ll tell me, “Well Columbus sailed in 1492,” and that is correct, he did. But that is not the only thing that happened in 1492. In 1492, England and France signed a peace treaty. In 1492, the Borgias took over the papacy. In 1492, Lorenzo De’Medici, the richest man in the world, died. Okay? A lot of things happened, if there had been newspapers in 1492, which there weren’t, but if there had, those would have been the headlines, not this Italian weaver’s son taking a bunch of ships and sailing off to nowhere, okay? But Columbus is what we remember, not the Borgias taking over the papacy. Well, 500 years from now, people are not going to remember which faction came out on top in Iraq, or Syria, or whatever, and who was in and who was out and you know….but they will remember what we do to make their civilization possible, okay? \n\nSo this is the most important thing we could do, the most important thing we could do in this time, and if you have it in your power to do something great and important and wonderful, then you should. \n\n",

      "167": "Imagine you had a business selling lollipops at school. Since you can buy a bag of 100 for $10, you can sell them for 25¢ a piece for a profit. \n\nBut you don't have $10. But there is profit to be made for all if people give you the money. So you ask your friends to **invest**. They each give you $1 and you give them (and yourself) some **stock** in the **venture** - a promise to split the profit. You guys buy a bag, and in one week, you sell all your lollipops for 25¢ each. \n\nSo now you have 0 lollipops and\n25¢ x 100 = $25\nAwesome! \nMaybe you pay yourself a market rate for your job in the venture as salesman (you're also an employee since you sold the pops) - say $5\nSo you have $20 to split 10 ways. Everybody makes $2 from their $1 investment - everybody wins. you could pay them back their $1 investment and another $1 profit - this extra is called a **dividend**. \n\nNow, would your investors go in again next week? Sure! You're doubling their money. And you ran out of lollipops right? So maybe get everyone together to vote and we all agree at a **shareholder meeting** to skip the dividend and turn the venture into a **business** that reinvests the profit into 2 bags of lollipops and make money even faster. \n\nNext week you sell out again. Since you're just one sales guy, you still only cost $5 and your **profit margin** has risen. You can now buy 4.5 bags of lollipops each week. Your business is growing! \n\nNow the new kid in school has noticed your business and he wants to buy a share. You **sold** a share to your friends for $1. But now each week, thay share grew in the potential value of its dividend. So how much should a share cost today? Even though the investors haven't actually gotten money back on the business, the share they own has grown in value as the business has grown. \n\nWell one of your old friends wants to buy a comic book that costs $5 and he has no allowance because he spent all his money buying his share the first week. He's ready to start making money back but the stockholders want to keep reinvesting the dividends. So some of the shareholders and the new kid, Martin get together on the playground and start talking. Comic book kid says is willing to sell his share. So he **asks** for $5 from Martin. But Martin doesn't want to pay that. So Martin **bids** $4.50.  There is now a **bid-ask spread of .50¢** - meaning it's less likely for a sale to happen then if that spread was $0 and more likely than if the spread was $1. The stock might not actually sell today because the market is slow and sticky rather than **liquid**. The stock in the company is **illiquid**.\n\nSome more kids gather around. They're hip. They want to grow their lunch money. So they **bid** $4.75.,$4.85, $4.95 - **sold** comic book kid thinks this is close enough and a transaction happens. The market is gaining **liquidity** as more buyers and sellers gain interest.\n\n\nBut now Martin's got hella-bad FOMO (fear of missing out). He offers $5.10 to buy it from the new owner. Seeing the **stock price** rise, other owners consider selling. They consider **holding**. They consider buying more. All start negotiating. Some kids call their parents and ask for an advance on their allowance. Some  parent hear about this crazy business that doubles each week and they tell the kid to act as a **broker** on the trading floor and do the deal on the parent's behalf. Baby, you've got yourself a stock pit. \n\n\n## Waaaaaaahhhh!!! Okay, okay Part II\n**Market, Limit, Stop orders; Futures contracts; Options; Shorting; Insider trading, and market manipulation**\n\nNone of this stuff affects the **profit** of the company. The stock was sold in the **initial public (school) offering** (IPO). And since then, the company itself has just sold lollipops and reinvested in growth. But if they want to grow more they can get all the shareholders together and vote to sell more shares. This **dilutes** the existing shareholders, but if it helps grow the company, the stock price will go up and it means a smaller slice of a bigger pie - so they decide to do it. They **issue more shares**.\n\nSo Lollipop Co. (ticker: LOLI) is booming. I mean, it basically doubles every week so people want more stock. And neighborhood adults and local business owners want to grow their money. So they head over to the playground and ask the teachers if they can get in to buy some stock. The teacher are like, \"Um... no you can't go on the playground, you don't go to this school and you're an adult, perv. So the local adults pass notes to the kids to buy stock on their behalf and have the kids **broker** a deal. But the price different people will sell for keeps moving so the kid asks, \"what price are you willing to buy it at?\" And the parent (client) can say:\n- place a **limit order** - I'll only pay up to $6.50 and if it moves past that before you can find a seller, cancel it \n- place a **market order** - I'll buy it at any price you can get it for over the next hour or so. \n- place a **stop order** - for some reason I only want to buy above a certain price. Probably because if it is moving down in price I think it will keep moving down. \n\nThese purchases are getting complicated and kids don't want to work for free. Adults (institutional investors) have *a lot* of money compared to kids. Each aggressive purchase makes the stock price move up. \n The broker kids get paid a fee - maybe 25¢. But the adults are buying like $1000 in stock at a time. So a really clever kid, Max, decides to start buying LOLI when his adult does. Since the stock price was like $7, if an adult wants to buy 1000 shares, the price has to move up as he asks kid after kid after kid to sell all his shares. He knows this means the stock price will get higher and higher - so he personally buys as much as he can before he starts trading for his adult. He has invented **frontrunning**. \n\nTeachers see this and get upset because frontrunning drives the price of the stock up for neighborhood adults unfairly and those adults are the tax payers that pay the teacher's salary. So they declare frontrunning against the rules. \n\nMeanwhile, as the CEO and sole employee (I guess) of Lollico. you know the weekly sales figures before anyone else. You could **manipulate** the market price by leaking information about it. You can say the sales are low, then buy up stock and say - \"psych\" (do kids still say psych?) and watch the price rise. Teachers hate this too because again it makes the taxpaying adults mad. So they say its against the rules and call it **market manipulation** - specifically it is **misreporting financials** and **insider trading**. The opposite is **pump and dump**.  So now you need to file a record of your sales and expenses with the Special Educational Council or **SEC** (securities and exchange commission - a stock is also called a security for some reason) that ensures everybody is following the rules. \n\nMax - recently released from timeout - has another brilliant idea. LOLI is now at $4,555 because of all the adults who have bought in. This time, he thinks that this whole LOLI thing is way oversold. He thinks the stock isn't worth what the market says because Max actually read my ELI5 and understands that fundamentally, the stock is worth what **dividends** it can pay you and there aren't enough kids at this school to buy millions of dollars of lollipops. Max wants to bet against the price of the stock going up. He can do this a few ways. One way is to \"borrow\" a stock from some adults. So Max, while he doesn't own the stock, has borrowed it from an adult (as a loan for a small interest rate called **security lending**) and sold it for less (**short**) than what it might be worth at the immediate current price. He now has a bunch of borrowed cash - $4,555 and owes one share of LOLI in 30 days back to the lender. If the price moves up, he will owe a lot of money to those adults in order to buy back the stock at a higher price. Potentially infinite money if the price keeps climbing and he can't buy it. Shorting is dangerous - but Max likes to live dangerously. He shorts the stock and then goes around asking kids if they've ever gotten a dividend. No one seems to understand what a dividend is - it has been like a whole month since LOLI went public (school) and everyone forgot. Max explains why stocks have value and all of a sudden everyone freaks out and starts selling before their stock is worthless. The stock tumbles down to $15 where he is easily able to buy it before paying back his adult lender and Max pockets the $4,540 difference. He's basically the only one who made mad lunch money at this point.\n\nBut the company is fine - they're still selling lollipops. \n\n\n\n",

Probably one of the most famous is the series of five UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters that crashed between 1981 to 1987. The accidents were a mystery for some time, but it was later confirmed that they were caused by signals from radio tower which caused the stabilator to go to a full down position, which put the helicopter in a dive. These accidents earned the UH-60 the nickname \"lawn dart\" at the time. \n\nIIRC in the 1990s it was quite common for the crew to instruct passengers to turn off all electronic devices for take off and landing. This is because it was not uncommon for devices to cause things like radio static or in severe cases minor interference with navigation.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not sure that consumer grade electronics ever posed a deadly threat to commercial aircraft. However, EMI shielding and testing was not nearly as thorough back then as it is now. Part of the reason for that is small electronic devices were not ubiquitous back then. Asking people to simply turn off an electronic device during take off and landing (critical phases of flight for navigation and radio communication) was not a big deal to people back then. It was easier for the FAA to just require that they be turned off, than to require extensive (and expensive) testing. \n\nAdditionally, I'm not aware of any credible sources which say that the reasoning was that passengers would pay more attention in the event of an emergency.

Think of it like a prism- the one beam of white light can be broken down into multiple beams of colored light. Each of those \"colors\" (the light used in fiber operates at wavelengths invisible to humans) can carry as much data as your modulation scheme allows for- say 1Gbps to make it easy. \n\nUsing dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) we can fit 80 of those wavelengths onto one strand. And of course most fiber cables are multiple strands- lets say its a small cable with only 12. Doing the math, that's almost 1Tbps of bandwidth on a fiber cable. \n\nReal life applications can carry even more, it all depends on the equipment being used. As our technology improves we'll be able to modulate more data per wavelength and pack more wavelengths per strand.",

This means after the lumber was milled, it went into a kiln to have the moisture content reduced. The moisture being removed is typically sap not water. From this point on, the lumber will more easily absorb and expell moisture. From the kiln on that lumber will likely be outside in the elements until it gets framed into a house. Once out of the kiln it will get tarped. Most lumber tarps are not water proof so the lumber will get wet every time it rains. From there they sit in the mills yard until sold to a distributor. It is usually shipped by rail on a lumber car, which has no roof. From there it will sit in the distributors yard until it goes to a retail lumber yard. Shipped usually by transport truck at this point, also not covered. Retail lumber yards (big box stores excluded) typically store their lumber outside. From there the lumber is sorted into framing loads and re banded for delivery to a house being framed. There is typically no tarp on these loads at all. And from there it gets framed into a house, where it will get over a month to dry out before insulation, poly, drywall go up and seal the wall cavity.

We are no smarter than the people who came before us, but we have the benefit of their experience.\n\nAnyways. You wanted to know \\*WHY\\* this region of the fingernail is discolored, or at least why it's colored differently from the rest of the nail. The answer is that this region of the fingernail forms part of the NAIL MATRIX. This is basically the root of the nail bed, which is the region that's responsible for the growth of the entire fingernail.\n\nIf you damage the lunula of the nail, then you can often see predictable results. This is the house where the rest of the nail is built. Much of the nail matrix lives under the skin at the base of your fingernail. Damaging the nail matrix will fuck up the growth of the entire nail.\n\nYou'll sometimes see lines called Beau's Lines if you damage the lunula or the portion of the nail that's more proximal to it  (google beau's lines if you'd like).

      "196": " \n\nThere's quite a few different tactics used to keep produce fresh during transportation and storage:\n\nTemperature  - Just like your fridge at home, produce is kept cool (generally not  frozen as the formation of ice crystals damage plant structure). Lower  temperatures cause chemical reactions, and thus life itself to slow  down. Both the produce itself and any fungi or bacteria that can spoil  the produce are slowed down preventing the food going off.\n\nHumidity  - Many living organisms are reliant on water to survive, and reducing  humidity either by refrigeration or direct removal of water from the  surrounding air inhibits fungal and bacterial growth.\n\nRemoval  of spoiling organisms - As discussed above,  fungi and bacteria spoil  produce. After picking the produce may be simply washed, sprayed with  biocides or exposed to gamma or UV radiation to reduce or destroy fungi  and bacteria on the produce.\n\nMaintaining  a sterile environment - Again those major spoiling agents come into  play again. Once they have been removed, these organisms need to be  prevented from infesting the crop during transport. Sterile gases free  of oxygen can be pumped around the produce, inhibiting the growth of  aerobic spoiling organisms. Alternatively, biocides can be sprayed onto  the produce or even a simple wax coating (common for citrus and pome  fruits) inhibit the growth of spoiling organisms.\n\nPicking  unripe produce - Produce is picked at a stage where it isn't ripe, but  is fully capable of becoming so by itself without any input from the  plant it was picked off. When the still unripe produce is approaching  its destination, plant hormones such as ethylene introduced to induce  ripening.\n\nCrop genetics - The  genetics of the crops themselves affects how long they take to ripen and  how long they can last before becoming overripe. For example, crops  with the genes for reduced ripening hormone production were selected so  the produce ripens slowly, unless humans artificially introduce these  hormones when we want them to ripen.\n\nThese  improvements (in particular refrigeration) are highly effective and  have enabled the globalised food economy we see today. Often the apples  you eat in Spring and Summer are ones picked from the Autumn before,  stored in cooled sterile warehouses and induced into ripening in special  lorries on the way to the supermarket.",

At that point, the next optimal nap length is 90 minutes because you complete one sleep cycle in that time.\n\nCaffeine works primarily by blocking adenosine receptors, but once it fades away, you suddenly have all that adenosine that it had been holding back rush in to the receptors. This is a caffeine crash.\n\nSo, here's how caffeine naps work:\n\nYou make a very strong cup of coffee (usually I go with two espresso shots) and drink it as fast as you can without burning yourself. 10 minutes is your target.

So even though you have a bunch of this chemical in your brain because you've been awake for a long time (or you didn't get enough sleep last night), caffeine falsely tricks your brain into thinking \"wow, there's basically no adenosine here at all, I must be properly well rested and not have any need for sleep right now!\" This leads to a clear-headed and alert state of mind, as your brain isn't trying to get you to wind down for sleep because it thinks you don't need any. Think of the receptors like smoke detectors - caffeine stops them from detecting the smoke.\n\nThe reason you get a headache from withdrawal is because unfortunately, eventually your brain cottons on to the trick caffeine is playing, and it creates new receptors to measure the levels of adenosine. So it's like \"Ah, you're blocking my receptors to stop me measuring it! No problem, I'll make new ones, and there won't be enough caffeine to block *all* of them\". This is why, over time, you need more caffeine in order to feel the same effects. The brain simply adjusts to the caffeine and tries to return your sleep cycle to normal. The headache arises because when you *don't* drink caffeine, your brain falsely believes you're a lot *more* tired than you are, because these receptors are measuring all of the adenosine in your brain - but your brain had become used to not measuring much of it at all, because the caffeine was blocking it. So now, it thinks you're suddenly absolutely *wrecked*, because out of nowhere, it's detecting a whole bunch of adenosine that it wasn't detecting before.\n\nAs regards permanent changes, we don't really know. Abstaining from caffeine for several weeks causes a \"reset\" of sorts - after a few weeks, your brain realises that most of the extra receptors it created are surplus to the amount of adenosine you actually have, and it starts getting rid of them again. In theory, there's no reason why this would change over time, but it's not fully understood or known right now, so nobody can say for sure.\n \n \n \n**EDIT**: Holy *shit*, I did NOT expect this level of interest when I posted this! Thanks for all the precious metals, kind caffeinators!\n\nA lot of people have written some incredibly interesting questions and replies in response to this, I'll hopefully be able to answer a lot of them tomorrow!\n\nTwo things:\n\n1: You're absolutely correct, caffeine also has a vasoconstrictive (narrowing blood vessels) effect, but this effect itself isn't what causes the headache - it's actually caused by the blood vessels rapidly *dilating* when the caffeine wears off. This is an important aspect of the caffeine-related headache which I forgot to mention, as I was thinking purely of the effects on brain chemistry - which also play a role in adding to and triggering headaches. Thanks to everyone who pointed this out!\n\n2: \"Tireder\" may indeed not be a word in most English speaking countries, but I can assure ye that it is used extensively in Ireland 😂 The Irish dialect of English has a lot of leftover quirks, because a lot of our grammar is derived from the original Irish language and then transposed on top of English, which we started speaking because our lovely ancestral neighbours obnoxiously objected to us speaking Irish whilst they were pillaging the place and generally getting up to all kinds of mischief.

And this comment is of course meant in jest, I adore our present-day English neighbours and can be immediately and helplessly hypnotised by a woman speaking in an English accent 😂\n\nFinally, the rambling nature of the above comment most likely came about because while caffeine can keep us physically awake, it cannot stem the inevitable descent into madness and moronity which accompanies staying up all night partying two nights in a row.

Underwater sources aren't affected by this.\n\nHowever, making noise underwater requires more energy per dB, because water is 1000x as dense.   You need to vibrate 1000x the mass, which is ~~30dB~~ *60dB* (darn convention changes) of attenuation.  Our ears also judge sound logarithmically, where each 10dB sounds about 2x as loud.  So equal sound sources at equal distances underwater sound about ~~32x~~ *64x* as quiet.\n\nAdditionally, you'll kind of feel muffled, not just from the drop in volume, but because the sound doesn't seem to come from any direction.   Our brains are very well trained to find the direction of a sound source by the difference in time of arrival between our ears. That tells us left, right, or center, and the shape of our ears and face blocking sound from certain directions helps us judge forward/backward and up/down by subtle differences in volume.\n\nSound traveling 5x as fast makes the time delay only 1/5 as long. And since the volume is already significantly attenuated, we have trouble judging forward/backward from the small difference in volume caused by the shape of our ears. So everything sounds like it's coming from right in front of us, or on top of us.\n\n**TL;DR** Sound under water is ~60x quieter, and it's really hard to tell where it's coming from.

      "234": "I was actually just reading a book on this yesterday!\n\nThere's so much stuff going on around you that if you were to actually consciously receive all of the data your brain takes in from all five senses it would overload and you'd have a killer headache. In order to mitigate this the brain has something called the human attentional system which makes sure that you pay attention to all the stuff you need to know without looking at every single thing.\n\nThe attentional system has four parts: You've got your two modes of consciousness, which are mind-wandering mode and central executive mode, you've got your attentional filter, which is responsible for deciding what you get to passively pay attention to and what you get to ignore, and you've got your attentional switch, which is what changes your brain in between the two modes of consciousness.\n\nYour mind-wandering mode is your brain's default mode, and it's where you are when you're reading a book without getting anything from it. It's a stream-of-consciousness type deal, where neural networks and the thoughts they create connect with each other almost randomly, linked by small similarities that bridge thoughts together. Daydreaming and REM sleep are examples where your brain is almost completely in mind-wandering mode. This is your default mode because when you don't need to be paying attention to anything your brain tries to conserve its energy; *just like other parts of your body your brain runs on glucose, and when it runs low it gets tired, and you feel it.* That's why it's physically exhausting to take a four-hour exam; focusing takes effort and energy.\n\nYou central executive mode is what is popularly considered to be your consciousness: it's the part of your essence that pays direct attention to no more than four or five things at a time and in much more detail than any of the thoughts your mind-wandering mode spawns and connects. When you focus on something you bring it to the forefront of your central executive mind. This can be both voluntary and involuntary. An example of an involuntary focusing is when you hear a really loud noise that *your attentional filter has not come to expect as part of your natural environment*. It's impossible for you to not think about the sound and/or it's source. That's just the way we were built so we'd run away from scary animal sounds. Voluntary focus is literally when you try to focus on something: reading that book, trying to flip a water bottle perfectly, or reading an unnecessarily long Reddit post.\n\nYour brain tries to conserve energy by staying in its mind-wandering mode whenever its central executive mode is not needed.\n It manages this by\n\nA) using its attentional filter, which decides what activates the attentional switch and what doesn't (i.e. what grabs your attention). \n\nB) Delegating tasks to your mind-wandering mode, so that if something is familiar enough *you will do it in your sleep!* Well not really, but both sleep and these delegated tasks are managed by the same mode.\n\nYour attentional filter works by detecting change. The longer a stimulus is active or the more familiar you are with it in general the less likely it is to grab your attention. If you're in a building right now think about the sound of the air conditioning unit, or the location of your tongue, or what your left middle finger is touching right now, or the fact that your brain will always delegate breathing and blinking to your mind-wandering mode unless you specifically think about it! These are all stimuli or processes that are either very familiar to you or have been present in your current environment for a long time. If it hasn't killed you in the past half hour it's probably not going to kill you now, so why bother giving it attention? Your attentional filter lets through alien or unexpected stimuli so you can decide whether those things will kill you or not.\n\nNow to actually answer your question!\n\nThe longer you read a book the longer it remains a part of your environment. Therefore as time goes on your attentional filter will passively block out the book, which means your focus will need to be kept entirely by the central executive mind. This takes effort. Your brain wants to minimize effort, so it looks for ways to make this easier. You are probably a reader extraordinaire, so your brain decides to delegate the reading to your mind-wandering mode. That way you can read with minimal effort and think about something else at the same time. Unfortunately your mind-wandering mode is not very good at processing non-random information, so you just end up reading the words while not actually interpreting them while thinking about something else. So yes, it is due to a lack of focus.\n\nIf you have any more questions please ask me! I really like this topic and have the book right on my desk, so I can probably help you out. \n\nSpeaking of books, if you want a non-butchered explanation of this I recommend you read *An Organized Mind* by Daniel J.

Weird dream last night? Now the rest of your morning feels off. Something as simple as a television show or song with a certain atmosphere will cause someone's mood to shift. The possibilities are kind of endless. \n\nOne thing you have to remember is that mood and overall mental health are controlled by a very complex set of physiological factors. Your nervous system, hormones, and even the bacteria in your gut all work together to create a balance of both \"good\" and \"bad\" emotion. So, at any one time, fluctuations in these areas can cause you to experience fluctuations to your emotional state, even if there's no obvious external reason for you to feel differently. \n\nI'm not a neuroscientist or psychologist, so I'd love to see someone provide a more in depth answer in this area. However, I will say that emotions like anger or happiness or disgust (etc etc) all play a very large role in our decision making and motivational processes. This means that we NEED emotion to properly function and make decisions. This includes sadness as well. So, you might even be able to argue that episodes of sadness (even for no real reason), are inevitably needed to keep us functioning. \n\nEDIT: When I say that we need emotions in our motivational or decision making processes, I'm referring to something in psychology called \"the somatic marker hypothesis\". The hypothesis states that emotional \"markers\", such as the sweating and rapid heart beat associated with anxiety, help us to make decisions where cognition alone might fail us. The parts of the brain associated with the somatic marker hypothesis are the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. When damage to these areas occur (such as in traumatic brain injury) it has been found that individuals are more likely to make risky decisions on gambling tasks. Why? Because they aren't experiencing the same emotional reaction to betting or losing, meaning they are less likely to \"learn from their mistakes\" because they don't experience or process disappointment or regret in the same way. There are lots of studies done on this using something called the Iowa Gambling Task. That's just one example of how emotions impact decision making. Feelings of fear and regret play a huge role in mitigating risk behaviour alone. \n",

For this reason, it is inappropriate to think of the vacuum of space as having a temperature.\n\nWhat is true is that objects in the vacuum of outer space are often at the extremes of temperature. The reason for this is the fact that you do not have any air or water to help spread heat around (aka, \"convection\"). An object exposed to sunlight in space heats up just like an object exposed to the sun on earth, but on earth the air will carry away some of that heat. When we insulate things on earth to try and keep them hotter/colder than the surroundings (homes, food, etc), we either surround them with vacuum, or we do our best to keep the air from easily moving (styrofoam, fiberglass, blankets).\n\nAn astronaut's suit is typically white so that it does not absorb much heat energy from the sun to begin with, because the biggest concern in space for a human is generally getting rid of excess heat produced by the astronaut's body. The sunlight is a little brighter without the atmosphere absorbing stuff, but in general it's not a ton of energy from the sun, and in Low Earth Orbit (where the ISS is), you only have about 45 minutes of direct sunlight max as you circle the planet. The astronaut's suit includes a water cooling system that helps to combat the fact that they are basically in a vacuum thermos. Because our bodies are used to being able to dump our excess heat into the air around us and we get hot when we can't (imagine being wrapped in blankets), the heat has to go somewhere.\n\nThe ISS itself gets rid of excess heat the only way it can in a vacuum environment: by radiating heat energy in the form of infrared light into the darkness of space. The ISS uses ammonia-filled fins that are kept in shade to do this. They use ammonia because it can hold onto more heat energy drop per drop than water.\n\nScenes from movies where someone is exposed to a vacuum and instantly freeze are very, very unrealistic. If you were exposed to the vacuum of space, you would not have a great time, but as long as you didn't explosively decompress, you'd more or less stay your same temperature for a while and even survive if you were able to be rescued within a minute or so.

      "251": "You should really direct this question to /r/askeconomics. \n\nThe answer is quite simply that the economy doesn't *have* to grow. But we expect it to because of productivity-increasing technological advancement. When productivity rises, people can make more things with less time and other resources. We get richer. \n\nA steady state economy has been heavily analysed and was life for most of human history. It was a steady state because of the lack of technological advances causing higher productivity and higher output. \n\nThere's also a difference between equilibrium as in no movement and equilibrium in economics: the latter describes forces that return a market to its clearing state. \n\nHowever that is, answers talking about interest rates driving growth are wrong on a number of fronts. First, interest rates are a price. Prices are determined by supply and demand, not vice versa. Second, investment happening does not magically create growth opportunities. The relationship goes the other way: growth potentials happen and people invest in them. Third, a steady state economy (ie where c_t = c_t+1) will have positive interest rates based solely on liquidity preference: that people prefer to have cash now and are willing to exchange a series of payments (ie interest) for it.\n\nEDIT: Apparently, that people want money now and are willing to exchange future payments for it, absent an inflationary environment, isn't widely believed. Consider the Sumerians: They had a relatively stable money supply (they did not even have coins) and they had loans. Most early cuneiform tablets are in fact there to record those transactions. Next, consider a thought experiment where inflation is always zero (using magic). People will still borrow to meet transient consumption shocks that they cannot meet with cash on hand (healthcare is the classic example of this, also consider identity theft and natural disasters). Borrowing still exists.\n\nEDIT (cont): Even in a world with inflation, that inflation exists and people want to earn more than inflation doesn't explain why people would _borrow_ money, only why they would _lend_ it. There are always two actors in a non-coercive market interaction. To explain why credit markets exist, one must also have an explanation for why people borrow. If anything, inflation's existing would lower credit supply unless the interest rate were higher than inflation. \n\nRegarding perpetual growth: there is definite an upper bound to how far humans can develop economic output. We definitely are not anywhere near physical limitations on output. I've always found this claim to be something of an exaggeration. It's like saying that because FTL is impossible we should not expect any advances in spacecraft propulsion technologies.\n\nA number of helpful AskEconomics threads:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/4leo7r/eli5_why_are_economists_focused_on_growth/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/azspp2/can_economic_growth_continue_indefinitely_or_is/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/ae1cxd/why_is_the_predominant_economic_policy_an/",

Listen to the guitar sounds of the previous albums and compare them to these.  \n\n\nThe harmony work bestowed upon She's Leaving Home is beautiful, but of course you cannot appreciate it with just one listen. Find the main vocal, then try to follow John's harmonies and then George's.  \n\n\nThe cinematic lyrics of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds leave nothing to chance.

      "266": "The math predicts their existence in almost exactly the same way that math predicts you can push on a rope (which, famously, you can't).  A perfectly straight rope can hold tension (of course) and also, if it happens to be *perfectly straight* the same spring equation that works to predict the rope's behavior under tension also predicts the rope's behavior under compression.  If it were perfectly straight you could totally push on the ends.\n\nThe reason we have *tug* of war contests but not *push* of war, is that rope is unstable under pushing.  It simply won't hold the perfect shape to support the push, it'll bend to the side instead.\n\nSpacetime has a similar type of effect.  The equation that describes spacetime has a bunch of solutions about gravity pulling stuff in.  If the gravity is strong enough, you get a \"black hole\" that sucks in everything that gets close enough.  \n\nIt turns out that there are other solutions about gravity pushing stuff out.  Those are called \"white hole\" solutions.  A while ago someone noticed that you could connect a \"white hole\" to a \"black hole\" and get a \"wormhole\" that would suck stuff in on one side and push stuff out on the other side, and it would all hang together nicely.  And also satisfy the math.\n\nThe problem with wormholes is the problem with white holes.  They can't exist, for the same reason you can't push on a rope.  If you somehow created a white hole, it would tend to break itself apart.  If you created a wormhole, it would pinch off into a separate black hole and white hole -- and the white hole would break itself apart.  \n\nOnly black holes (which suck everything in) turn out to be stable, even though the equations can have \"perfect\" solutions that start with exactly the right shape.  Just like a rope -- if a rope is perfectly straight and perfectly made, you can push on it.  But real ropes aren't perfectly made, nor perfectly straight -- and if you push on one, it will bend out to the side instead of carrying the push.\n\n*Edit: I didn't expect this much interest in a basic ELI5.  The pushing-on-a-rope analogy can only be stretched so far (heh).  If you want more information on this kind of thing, I suggest Kip Thorne's awesome book \"Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy\".

Yes, i worked the first FOUR years of my engineering career at a factory in rural America that produced approximately 2 million pounds of unsliced turkey deli meat per week.  I still work for one of the largest producer of turkey in the world.  The answer almost exclusively boils down to economics.  Turkey is a lower cost protein to make than chicken (by a small margin...but feed inputs are roughly 70% of the cost of poultry and turkeys are more efficient feed converters.  Every little bit counts here).  On top of this turkey is incredibly seasonal.  Thanksgiving, christmas, and to a lesser extent easter are when turkey producers make their money and spend the rest of the year trying not to lose it.  You cant just turn on the giant industro-ag machine that is turkey production for three holidays so production must remain relatively stable year round.  People dont buy whole turkeys throughout the year so producers have to get creative.  Enter turkey bacon, burgers, and.....deli breast!  Essentially...if you want reasonably priced thanksgiving and christmas turkeys...the industry has to find creative ways to sell it year round....the white goes to deli, dark goes to ham, bacon, and burgers.  If you have any other questions i would be happy to answer! Poultry is my life! Currently working at a large cooked chicken plant (edited to remove a customer reference...don't want to get make anyone mad...i can't/won't be able to answer questions about specific customers or products)\nEdit to add a few other economic factors...turkey takes substantially longer to grow than chicken so contracts on pricing are easier to secure.  Chicken grows in weeks...so your contract price might look great the first flock...but feed prices change rapidly and if you lock in a year contract on chicken you could be getting screwed.  Also, there are higher margin outlets for chicken breast than deli meat.  Restaurants dont want to serve turkey because its slow to cook...chicken is fast and with high margins...chicken breasts are incredibly popular at the meat case for grilling.  If you can get it in your store, buy a raw turkey tenderloin to marinate and grill! Best cut of meat to grill bar a ribeye!\nEdit a second time to say thanks for the gold.

Your vocal cords are just onthe other side of that bump. \n\nYour upper airway (voice box and above) is very sensitive. When stuff goes down the wrong way and it feels stuck in your throat, it's in this area.

The rule of thumb is if an medical issue is affecting your life and makes you change how you're living, then it's time to get treatment. If your swallowing problem is making you too embarrassed to eat in public, or you have to avoid eating certain foods - GET HELP. If your speech problem is keeping you from getting or keeping a job, or makes you anxious to talk in public - GET HELP. Talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to a speech therapist.

But, from my perspective as a urologist...\n\nThe muscles involved most directly during an orgasm have closely linked nerve roots/nerves to those innervating the muscles of the upper leg. Specifically, these will be the adductors of the leg (the muscles that allow you to close your legs). As an example, in men... the obturator nerve, that controls the adductors, runs alongside the prostate gland and innervates the muscles around it, too. When the leg muscles contract, those around the prostate do as well (a bit more complicated than this, but that's the gist), and that *squeeze* feels good during, or before, an orgasm.",
      "283": "You feel like you're going extremely fast on a bike because you *feel* more.\n\nCars have very well developed suspension systems that \"even out\" the bumps on the road. As long as you're not dealing with a serious pothole or a speed-bump, the car's suspension is going to face-tank most of the shock so that you don't have to. Larger tires can also take some of the shock out of the road, but it's not as effective. Bikes generally *don't* have awesome suspension, and tires of *comparable* size. That means that you feel every bump in the road, or close enough to every bump in the road as not to matter.\n\nBeyond that, cars are enclosed capsules. Your body's perception of \"speed\" relies on three things: what you see with your eyes, what your inner-ear feels, and what your skin feels. When you're on a bike, you can feel the wind running over your body. That allows you to \"feel\" your speed when you aren't accelerating or slowing down. Your eyes give you a sense of speed, but the brain is pretty good at filtering out unwanted implications from the eyes.\n\n> Side Note\n\n> The Inner Ear mostly just registers acceleration, for the purposes of this conversation. It picks up when you speed up, or when you slow down. It's also a part of your sense of balance, but that's not too crucial to note in this situation.\n\nIt's basically a combination of being able to feel the wind, and the poor shock-absorption.",

      "288": "1) Space is flexible with time, in a specific squishy way.  Call it \"M\" because we'll refer to it later. The squishiness of space and time follows a specific set of rules for 3D manipuation, called a \"pseudo-Riemannian manifold\".  The way it squishes is called a tensor, and it follows geometrical laws.  There are a bunch of formulas involved in that manipulation, but it means you can convert between time and space, that stuff in space affects time, and stuff in time affects space.\n\n2) There are a bunch of values well call \"X\" that can modify space and time. They represent forces and fields. They follow special ordering rules, and form a gauge group. You can use these values X to modify the squishy thing in the first point. These things represent energy and motion. They have specific ordering requirements, and they cannot be easily reversed.  As an ELI5 of that if you have 3 and you subtract 3 you don't always get 0; if you want to get zero again you have to do extra steps.  These explain the relationship of how you can squish space and time around to change their shapes.\n\n3) Subatomic particles that make up matter, called fermions, that all meet a general pattern. This things make up mass. The pattern formula has multiple solutions, and includes both a positive side and negative side. Even though it has two sides, they're not opposites from each other like you would have +3 and -3 that are equal and map to each other, the two opposite sides are not isomorphic.  These things still have some big questions to be answered, but they explain how you can manipulate matter and space.  (There is another set, called bozons, that have a similar relationship with energy).\n\nSo an ELI5 rewrite:\n\n> We can see three fundamental things about the universe:  (1) Space and time are squishy according to a set of rules.  We have math that predicts it.  (2)  Squishing space and time depends on ordering and a second set of rules, and any squishes generally cannot be easily undone. We have math for predicting this, too. (3) Subatomic particles another set of rules that build all matter, but we only have most of the math to model it, not quite all of it for a complete model.\n\n> Putting those three topics together gives all our current rules for space, time, energy, motion, and mass, and conversions between them. \n\nUsing those general words describes the relationship of all the various conversions and systems we know in physics. The next picture in the video shows a clip of a wall that depicts a bunch of the relationships.  Some are well known, like how E=mc^2 is the relationship between energy and matter and explains things like why converting matter into energy in an atomic bomb creates huge amounts of energy.  Others explain relationships with space and distance, and relationships with time.  They all inter-relate, something that relates with space and distance and time also must relate with motion  and force.\n\nI don't think it's particularly beautiful, but I can see why he likes it as a short summary of our current physics models.",

A siren passing in the distance, a bomb going off, or a bright flashing light will attract your attention because it is different and considered important. \nWhen you are asleep, your thalamus works the same way but on a more lenient system. Some stimuli might wake you up but if it isnt important enough you will fall back asleep without even remembering (a light turning on in the hallway or a dog barking).

      "291": "When you have the flu, you're really infected with a new, slightly altered influenza virus that circulates every year and usually peaks around winter.\n\nYour immune cells recognise it as foreign and launch an inflammatory response against it. Here are some of the causes of aches/pains/tiredness:\n\n1. Your blood vessels normally become a little leaky to allow immune cells to reach their target. In the case of the flu this is systemic (body-wide) so you get a generalised swelling as your tissues become more fluid- you might see this as puffy eyes and a runny nose, for example. This can be coupled with muscular aches as swelling can compress vessels and muscle cells.\n\n2. Very important signalling molecules are released by immune cells in response to infection. These are called cytokines. While their primary role is to activate further immune responses and kill the infecting agent, they also have some interesting off target effects. One such effect is on the brain; they depress you and give you that tired sluggish feeling of the flu. They also cause activate pain receptors to make you \"feel\" like you have been injured even though you have not. An interesting evolutionary argument for this is that if our predecessors were infected by some illness, they would be better off staying in their hidey-hole rather than going out hunting food etc. So even though the aches and pains may feel an unnecessary counterproductive feature of the immune response, it may have some benefit! (At least evolutionarily)",
      "292": "EDIT:  i am amazed and humbled by the kind words and beautiful stories shared here.  they are treasures.  please write them down so your sons and daughters can read them.  I threw this list together really fast and posted it.  imagine my surprise when i saw my in box and almost fell over.  so i made some changes, mainly in explaining more thoroughly and in more detail to \"explain like i am five\".  i also added a few, that i had forgotten.\n\nthe list was very errr, cold and clinical and i did not convey my love for this work.  some of your responses reminded me i need to address this.  we live in a \"youth worship\" western country, often where the wise elders are forgotten, death and dying are hidden, not discussed, taboo, whereas at one time in our past, death was as normal as birth, with the working close to the land and animals, we knew and were familiar with the natural swing of life and death.  we run from death, we do everything we can to make ourselves younger, and to avoid that inevitable experience we will all have.  working for hospice allows me to become a part of an elder's life, to bring my support to them when it may be needed most.  i consider it a calling to bring more awareness of the normal reality of death.  and more awareness of the incredible sweetness of being able to support a loved one through their passage.  i cannot convey to you the blessing of being able to walk with a patient from the beginning of their journey, to the end of their life.  it is the most vulnerable, most tender of mercies to be able to have the privilege to witness that passage.  if you have the opportunity to be present for an elder during this journey, please try to.  It may change you forever in a good way.  It is the most spiritual of moments I have had in my lifetime.  You may want to even volunteer for hospice to be able to serve our wise elderly and walk with them through this time, to acompany them at a time they may be abandoned (it happens).   You will be rewarded greatly.\n______________________________________\n\n\nHospice worker 26 years.\n\n1. Withdrawing from interaction.\n2. No interest in food or water (beware, pt can aspirate at this point if forced to eat or drink).\n3. 02 (oxygen blood saturation level often called \"sats\" or \"sat level\") levels dropping (70 and below),  Normal is 90s.  I find using the oximeter is very helpful.\n4. Color changes.. skin can go very pasty and grey\n5.  Mottling of knees, elbows.  Mottling is a kind of blue/ white effect on the skin that may look a bit like bruising.\n6.  Blueness of fingernail beds, slight facial blueness around nose, mouth.  Blank staring at ceiling or corner and or talking to a family member long deceased.\n8.  Muscle wasting at temples and eyes sinking into boney orbits\n9.  Apneic and or shallow respiration.  Near the end a patient will often start to breathe irregularly.  This is called apnea and or cheyne stokes respiration.  what you will see is the patient breathes, then pauses.  then breathes again.  this can go on for a while or it can be near the end.  as the patient gets closer to passing, the pauses will start to be longer than the breathing.  i.e. starting... 10 seconds of pause, 50 seconds of respiration.  then 20 second pause, 40 seconds of respirations (i use the second hand of my watch to count).  As the time passes, the pauses become longer and longer.  This is the place of truly near death.. as the pauses become longer and longer, the pauses will gently last until the patient gently passes.  it can be an almost seamless and very peaceful thing to watch.  they drift into death, and you wait for the next breath, and it just doesn't come.  these are the deaths one hopes for, the good deaths with family around the bed, as the patient literally just slips away.\n10.  Sweaty, hot skin and or clammy cold skin.\n11.  Small dove like sounds on exhalation.\n12.  Inability to interact verbally.\nRemember the sense of hearing lingers .. your loved one will hear you to the very very end despite showing no outward signs or inability to move or respond verbally.\n13.  Cooling of extremities (hands and feet).\n14.  Phlegmy sounds.  This is what is commonly called the \"death rattle\".  Pt cannot swallow their oral secretions at end of life and these may build up in the throat.  The sound you hear is the sound of the inhalation and exhalation air going over around and through those secretions in the throat.  Lay the patient on their side and the secretions can come out.  There is also a medication that can be used to help with this (drops) (can't remember name of it sorry) but the medication can take a while to take effect.  I have been told that though this is difficultf for us to hear, it is not painful for the patient.  This can be hard.  Sometimes the nurse can drain the mucousy secretions with a machine, but it is said that the more the machine is used, the more secretions are manufactured.\n15.  There is a type of respiration that is often seen near the end, and it is best described as breathing \"like a fish out of water\".  Patient will often use auxillary muscles (like their shoulders and upper torso) to try to breathe.  \n \n16. Pain.  \nA)     Physical pain.   What I have found is that it is very very difficult to die if you are in intractable pain.  the muscles are tense and hard, the body is wracked, the pain becomes all encompassing.  the goal is to make the patient comfortable and to ease pain.  this could mean trying differrent medications to assist with pain reduction.  I cannot tell you the many times that finally, once the patient is relieved of physical pain, they can RELAX and let go. \n\nB)    MYTH.. we do NOT kill our patients with medications.  this is ILLEGAL.  What we try to do is find the balance of pain relievers that will allow the patient to be pain free, and also allow them to still carry on with their normal activities and at the end, be able to speak or communicate if they are able.  example:  some patients are in so much pain when they come to us, they are unable to do anything.  with the right meds, one lady was able to take her crafts to her regular craft fair out of state with her hubby in their RV, for the last time, to say goodbye to all her craft fair colleagues she had known and worked with for 30 years.  another man was able to go spend a last visit at the cabin he built up in the mountains.   Another patient was able to go to disneyland with her family, one last time.  Medications are a wondrous thing.  We learn what the patient would like to do and we try to find the medications that will allow them to do that.  We will often pay for a final wish like this.\n\nC)     Emotional Pain.  Sometimes called spiritual pain.  releasing emotional pain can come with counseling with spiritual counselors and social workers (both available through hospice).   At end of life there may be issues that are unresolved with family members that have caused patient deep regret and grief.  EMOTIONAL PAIN CAN TURN INTO PHSYSICAL PAIN THAT NO PHARMACOLOGICAL MEDICATION CAN TOUCH.  Although sometimes resolution may be impossible, our counselors do their best to help patient resolve conflicts and issues that are a burden to patient and a burden to the family members.  NOTE:  these resolutions could mean the diffference between a peaceful death and a difficult death.  \n\nThere is something we can see, a definite change of pallor, expression, something hard to explain, that can tell an experienced eye that it is soon.\n\nIt is very hard to tell you exactly when it will happen but the above are some     things to watch for.\n______________________________________\n\nMany of your comments were around hearing at end of life.

You could say \"well there isn't one\", or you could say \"fuck it, let's say that the square root of -1 exists and just call it *i*\", in that case the square root of -4 would be 2i. \n\nNow is the time when people say \"Yeah but that doesn't really exist, you just made up *i* to do math with it\", no it absolutely does exist, the symbol of *i* was made up yes, but *in the same exact way that 0 was made up*. It's just a symbol, it represents a concept, for 0 that concept is \"nothing\" for *i* that concept is \"square root of negative numbers\".\n\nIf you have a hard time accepting that *i* is real, despite us not having \"numbers\" for it, then you should have a reasonable understanding of why \"0\" was revolutionary. Representing nothing is not entirely intuitive.\n\nThis goes for other \"number concepts\" as well.

One part of your question that hasn’t been answered is why you may only feel like you’ve been asleep for a few seconds.\n\nYou actually have a few internal clocks in your brain that keep track of time. Some of them rely on chemical changes within cells that help track your circadian rhythm. You also receive a tremendous amount of external input that impacts your circadian rhythm and sense of time  throughout the day as well. Obviously when you’re asleep, you receive little to no external input, so you’re in a state where your internal clocks are already being limited.\n\nThere are actually different systems your brain uses when it estimates time on a scale of minutes or hours. One part of your brain called the striatum helps judge time when you’re trying to pay attention to how much time is passing. When you’re asleep, this part of the brain functions rhythmically with sleep cycles and thus your sense of time might be affected based on its activity when you wake up.\n\nMore importantly, we’ve learned that our brain’s time estimation heavily utilizes short-term memory. One of the most important functions of sleep is processing short term memories. When our brain shuffles and sorts short term memories, the ‘time stamps’ probably get jumbled with them. This can mean that when you wake up, your brain sacrificed keeping track of time and will judge how long you’ve been asleep based on the ‘time stamp’ of the memory it was shuffling. It’s a crude analogy, but hopefully makes sense.\n\nI hope this helps answer part of your question, or at least you found it interesting!",

      "310": "Mirrors are usually pieces of glass with a metallic layer painted on (a [multi-step process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror#Manufacturing) to produce a well bonded shiny metal layer. For most mirrors, this metal layer is silver or aluminium.\n\nSo now the question is: why does silver (or aluminium) appear grey/silver in colour? Or more broadly speaking, what determines the colour of reflective metals?\n\nMetals have what is known as a [plasma frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_oscillation#mechanism). In simple terms, this frequency is the upper limit for electromagnetic radiation that the electrons in the metals can respond to. Frequencies higher will simply pass through and frequencies lower will be reflected. Basically, the electrons ~~can~~ can't 'keep up' to the high frequency vibrations and don't respond. When the electrons can 'keep up' (for EM waves with a frequency lower than the plasma frequency), they vibrate and re-emit that radiation. This is the reflected light we see.\n\nFor most metals, like silver and aluminium, this frequency is in the ultraviolet region. This means that all lower frequencies, such as the entire visible light range, are reflected. The result is a shiny white, silver. \n\nFor other metals, say copper, this plasma frequency is lower, closer to red in the visible light range of EM waves. This gives the reddish-brown colour of copper.",
      "311": "If the venom doesn't get stabbed into the bloodstream, then it will seem like nothing happened, and the predator will be OK.  But what really happens is pretty neat.\n\nPutting something in your mouth and then swallowing it is ALWAYS safer than poking it into your bloodstream.  \n\nJust like humans, many predators have a whole line of \"digesters\" that can make things safer to eat.  First, there is spit - chewing and mixing with spit is important for digestion because it helps make big chunks smaller, it helps smaller chunks slide down into the stomach, and the spit helps some things start to dissolve.  If you are chewing a venomous animal, there is a good chance that the chewing will burst the tissues where the venom is stored - that makes it less likely that the fangs or stingers can actually inject the venom.\n\nOnce the venomous parts get into the stomach, the acids within the stomach are often strong enough to \"de-nature\" many venom proteins.  \"De-nature\" basically means it changes shape to that it doesn't react the same way that it would have.  Then other enzymes begin to break everything down into even smaller chemical bits.  Those small chemical bits are mostly turned into new proteins that you need to rebuild your own cells, or energy that helps you move.\n\nSo eating venomous animals is not a super idea, because there are some risks of the venom getting through your skin (or digestive tract lining) but the venom itself is usually not dangerous to digest.\n\nOn the other hand, if you inject beef stew into your bloodstream, you could get very sick.\n\nEDIT:  I'm forced to amend my dangerous comments, as follows -\n1) Putting something in your mouth and then swallowing it is  ALMOST ALWAYS safer than poking it into your bloodstream.  If a doctor tells you otherwise, listen to your doctor. \n2) Don't eat sacks of venom and don't inject things into yourself.  EVER.  If a doctor tells you otherwise, listen to your doctor.\n3) Putting things in your butt is not quite the same as eating.  But it is ALMOST ALWAYS safer to put something in your butt than it is to inject it.  If a doctor tells you otherwise, listen to your doctor.\n4) If you aren't sure whether to eat something, put it in your butt, or inject it, move on to something you are more familiar with.\n5) I'm really surprised there weren't many responses talking about scorpions.

      "315": "If you want an actual ELI5, it means that the basis for the math of the derivatives market is $687 trillion  (what is known as the \"**notional**\"), but what's important to know is that the **actual value** of those derivatives contracts is far less than their **notional value** of $687 trillion, and so the derivatives market is not actually worth (or putting at risk) $687 trillion.\n\nLet's say a banana is worth $1 today - anyone can walk into a market and buy or sell a banana for $1. If today I agree to buy a banana from you tomorrow for $1, then we could say we have $1 of \"banana derivatives\" in place. However, we've both agreed that a banana is worth $1, so if tomorrow one of us backs out, neither of us cares unless the value of a banana has changed. If it hasn't changed then I can buy a banana for $1 somewhere else, because that's the price of bananas. Similarly, if it hasn't changed then you can go sell a banana for $1 somewhere else. There's no actual value to our contract, despite the fact that we had $1 in banana derivatives (notional value) in place. Not only is our contract not worth its $1 notional value, it's literally worthless to either of us entirely. The $1 is the expected actual value of the banana on the maturity date (and the expected actual value of the dollar itself on the maturity date, technically speaking), but the actual value of the derivative *contract* is $0.\n\nOur contract gains an actual value if the price of bananas changes over time. If tomorrow the price of bananas is $1.05, then suddenly the contract is worth $.05 to me because it saves me $.05 when I buy the banana. Similarly, it is worth -$.05 to you because it costs you that much to sell it to me for $1 if you could have sold it for $1.05 to someone else that day. So our $1 in banana derivatives is now worth a nickel, instead of nothing.\n\nThis plays out across the market. The $687 trillion in \"currency and credit derivatives\" is the same as the $1 in banana derivatives that we had. In theory, those $687 trillion in derivatives could represent $0 in actual value in those contracts. This is not the case - there have obviously been changes in market values since those derivatives were agreed - but it goes to show that $687 trillion is just a number used for the math. It does not represent the actual value of the contracts themselves, just the number used for math. The contracts will be worth a very small fraction of that $687 trillion.\n\nEdit: Two additional points in a \"think about it like you're 10\" spirit:\n\n* Parties will enter into derivatives contracts based on what they **expect** the actual value of the underlying thing (here, the banana) will be when the contract matures. So if bananas are worth $1 today but we think they'll be worth $1.02 on our future date, then we'll enter into a contract to buy/sell the banana at $1.02, even though the current price of bananas is only $1. Interestingly enough, this means that the actual value of all derivatives contracts on day 1 is **$0**, regardless of their notional, because the parties expect the price to be the price they've set. Doesn't matter how big the notional value is, on day 1 the parties would say the actual value of the derivatives contract is $0.\n* The notional value that gets cited does not take into account overall (\"net\") position across the market. So let's say we enter into our original $1 banana derivative where you're selling me a banana for $1, but then you separately agree to buy a banana from someone else for $1 in the same way. Now you have agreed to both buy and sell a banana for $1 each on the same day with two different people. There are $2 in notional now, but in reality all that's happening is you're buying a banana from someone for $1 and then immediately selling it to me for $1. Now we have $2 in banana derivatives, but the situation is no different than when we had only $1 in banana derivatives, all that's changed is there's a middle man between me and the original seller. And, again, the actual value of these contracts is $0 until the price of bananas unexpectedly changes.\n\nSo I hope it's clear that the notional value of a derivatives market is a VERY misleading way of thinking about what is going on in the market.",

I don't recall what normal readings are, but if it gets too high, or if they are doing an EVA for which the plasma potential is a problem (don't want to shock the crew members!), there is a device called the Plasma Contactor Unit, which emits a stream of ionized xenon gas to \"bond\" station structure to the plasma environment.",

As has been noted, the stuff is really sticky and if it has been aspirated (inhaled) can lead to breathing difficulties.  This can potentially be fatal so meconium at birth is not a good finding.\n\n- If a child fails to produce urine due to malformation of the kidneys or urogenital tract (bladder and urethra) a condition called oligohydramnios occurs.  Not only do we \"drink\" our urine as mentioned but we also \"breath\" it in the womb.  Babies inhale and exhale amniotic fluid.  If there is insufficient amniotic fluid because baby is not peeing, these breathing movements cannot occur normally and the lungs do not develop normally leading to severe problems at birth which can potentially be fatal.  In really severe cases of low amniotic fluid because baby is not making urine something called \"Potters sequence\" occurs.  \"Potters\" is not someone's name but comes from the fact that the child looks like they had been trapped in a clay pot.  They have abnormal development of the lungs because they have no \"breathing\" in the womb (the uterus has squeezed them and restricted this), have abnormal development of the joints in the arms, hands, and legs because they could not move (baby could not kick and move in the womb), and have abnormal appearance of their face because it was smushed by the womb.  They may not have the normal lines on the palms of their hands because they could not move them.  If severe enough oligohydramnios, the child will not survive due to the failure of the lungs to develop normally, the lungs look \"solid\" and not like \"sponges\" because they little sacs (alveoli) where oxygen adsorption occurs do not develop.  Peeing in the womb is REALLY important!",

Secondary sites are places like arms, legs, face, etc. When weight loss begins, you start to lose fat from the secondary sites first.

There are a couple of things to keep in mind about Germany; it is one of the largest and most populated states in Western Europe, and it has had a very strong industrial base for many many years.\n\nAfter WWI, Germany was in pretty bad shape. It owed a ton of money in war reperations. This issue was dealt with by the Nazis basically just refusing to pay them.\n\nMore importantly though, Germany might have lost the war, but even the winners were in really rough shape. No one was willing to stand up to the Nazis until it was too late. When they started to remilitarize, no one stepped up because they either thought that the lot they were dealt in WW1 was too harsh, or because they were too war-weary to care. When Germany started to absorb parts of its neighbors, it was justified by claiming that it was done either to protect German nationals, or because the Germans had been invited to do it (which is partly true in some cases). \n\nFurther, once WW2 started, the Germans had a couple big benefits. Most of their immediate neighbors were too weak to do much, France and Britain wanted to avoid bloodshed. When they invaded Poland, they got help from the Soviet Union. Once the war really got underway, France folded almost immediately, and the British were pushed off of the continent not long after. France was gone, Britain was technically still at war but couldn't mount an offensive, Italy was an ally, America, Spain, and the USSR were neutral, and much of Central Europe was already under Nazi control. They were able to take most of Europe without much of a fight. \n\nHelping matters even more, Germany benefited from having some pretty revoltionary tactics, scientists, and equipment. In particular, the Germans wrote the book on blitzkrieg and tank warfare, which proved instrumental.\n\nAfter they lost the war, the country was split into four administrative zones, occupied by the Americans, British, Soviets, and French. The American, British, and French zones were evnetually consolidated to become the country of West Germany, while the Soviet zone became East Germany. The Western Powers poured a ton of resources into rebuilding West Germany and getting them back up to speed (so that they could help fight the Soviets in the event of WW3). Since they're still one of the biggest and most industrial states in Europe, it's only natural that they've had a strong economy ever sense.\n\nEdit: Wow, I didn't expect this to blow up. RIP Inbox.

But if you instead have a 32 bit system (meaning that the biggest calculation it can do is on 32 bit), but the program asks for 64 bit calculation, you can't, so instead the cpu has to go all the way around, splitting each operand in multiple memory registers, making multiple operations to achieve one single sum or multiplication.\n\nIn everyday use, this kinda \"heavy stuff\" almost never happens, but apply that on heavy math software, cryptography and all sort of math things and the change is heavily relevant.\n\nLast note: as someone said already, another difference is that the same size of registers applies when the cpu asks the ram to save/load data.

      "347": "Microwaves cook by vibrating molecules at the atomic level, which creates friction and releases energy in the form of heat.  This means the heat is actually generated from inside the food, and not just blasting the outside surface of the food.  Microwaves can heat more parts of the food at once this way.  This heat then spreads to other parts of the food, heating it up.  If you've ever eaten something that was heated in the microwave and it had cold spots, it's because those spots had less water (or the microwaves aren't evenly distributed within the chamber).  This is why most microwave cooking instructions tell you to let the food rest, so that the heat can reach equilibrium throughout the food and you won't have cold spots.  Interestingly, this property is also what prevents most non-food objects from heating up in the microwave; they contain no moisture so they don't vibrate and thus don't generate heat. \n\nOn the other hand, ovens use a heating element (electric or gas, usually) to heat the air in the oven (convection), which means heat transfer must occur from the outside-in. As each \"layer\" of food is cooked, the next layer wants to reach equilibrium and starts taking heat from the warmer layers.  This process is called conduction.  It takes longer for each layer to heat because the previous layer needs to heat up first in order to transfer heat inward.  This process takes much longer, but unlike a microwave you don't end up with the uneven heating problem and don't need to let your food rest so the heat can be evenly distributed.  \n\nedit: a few nuances ",

Short distance vision correction can be approximated since you're **generally** not trying to read a book flying by you at 65mph (I mean, I assume so but I won't judge).\n\nAdditional Details:  \nFinally, there's a thing called \"astigmatism\".

That is why music that is \"in tune\" will sound more pleasant than music out of tune, because we don't listen to much music out of tune and therefore are not accustomed to it. Music that we do not like is generally music we cannot predict well and that doesn't stimulate us. By listening to music that we do not enjoy, we are forcing our brains to work hard at trying to guess what comes next but because it's no good at it, it needs to start from scratch again.\n\nA useful analogy is that of how a (computer) processor predicts what it needs to do:  \nFirst it will pick which branch (of multiple possible choices) of execution to expect.  \nThen, possibly before it even knows which branch it will *really* take, it will load some relevant information into memory.  \nWhen the CPU realizes that it is following another path, it has done a lot of work for nothing and discards the information and starts over from the beginning of the mispredicted branch.\n\nIt's possible that our brains evolved this \"feature\" to reward intelligence (or rather, being good at predicting outcomes), but since I am a software engineer and not a biologist or geneticist, I really wouldn't know.\n\n**Edit** (disclaimer) to clear up some confusion:  \nI never stated that our brains *prefer* predictability over spontaneity, just that predictability *plays a part* in it.

All powered lift aircraft need to grab big chunks of air, and throw them at the ground.  Getting a good grip on the air, is really controlled by how big of a wing (rotor, prop, whatever..) you have.  The most efficient part of a wing is the part furthest from the tip, and moving the fastest.  Helicopters get this right, by having long blades, and few rotor tips.  Multirotors get it wrong, by having LOTS of tips, and short blades.    \n\n\nI\"m making a very strong case, against multirotors.  And for carrying people, large loads, and doing many tasks, they are really awful.  And when you start building a multirotor to carry heavy loads, fly long ranges, or have good flight times, they start looking a lot like normal helicotpers.  EG: a popular thing with the quad community is to build \"long range\" rigs.  Instead of the typical 4.5 or 5\" props, they're swinging 7\" props, more than doubling their effective swept area.    \n\n\nHelicopters, are also \"human controllable\".  That is, a meatbag at the controlls can fly it well.  To fly a multirotor, you need computers doing the work for you.

      "372": "Because water is actually pretty hard to store. We need a *lot* of it, far more than we need fat or sugar. Water is also pretty easy to obtain, so we don't *need* to store it. Things that do only do so because they can't get it regularly: cacti, camels... \n\nWater is also not only something we discard, it's how we discard *other* things, things that we have to discard due to their toxicity like urea. A high water intake and output is important for our overall health because it keeps us efficiently removing toxic waste products from our systems. \n\nWe actually do store certain vitamins - fat soluble vitamins. Some vitamins are water soluble though, so we have no way of storing them. To store any chemical our body has to sequester it from the water inside our cells. Fat-soluble molecules naturally remove themselves from water anyway, but water soluble ones have to be made water *insoluble* in order to store them, which means modifying them so that they're not vitamins anymore. \n\nThe problem with storage of fats and sugars is that we evolved to be able to survive droughts and other unpredictable conditions. We store excess energy (in the form of fats and sugars) so that we can't be caught off-guard if we ever enter a period of starvation. Fat storage is also a useful insulating tool remaining from when we hadn't invented central heating. So, we have all these mechanisms for storing fats and sugars, but we now live in an environment where starvation pretty much never happens unpredictably and we don't need to build large energy stores. The body always assumes the worst because it's evolved to do so, and if you're over-eating regularly its assuming that a starvation period is coming. So if you're constantly over-eating your body is constantly trying to stockpile energy in fear of an oncoming winter or something, but that never comes and you just keep on eating. \n\nThe body is actually *incredibly* efficient about what it does and doesn't store. It stores everything it needs to be able to store (and can store at all). That's how evolution works after all - it tends towards making the most efficient versions of things possible, as long as more efficiency means a higher survival rate. If it doesn't need to store more energy, then it sends us messages telling us we don't need to eat. If you're storing more fat and sugar than you need, it's because you're *eating* too much fat and sugar, ignoring those messages, or because of some genetic defect that is meaning that messaging system isn't working properly. Or because of gut bacteria. That's the new focus of dietary science.\n\nAlso, the reason we can't store water soluble things is because it's actually toxic to do so. A lot of our body works on the relative concentration of water soluble molecules, and if we have too much of a water soluble molecule, we actually can't absorb any more of it without converting the water soluble molecule to an insoluble form. We actually have to use a very advanced mechanism to absorb glucose at all, that relies on the fact there's more sodium in our intestine than inside our cells.",

They have a lot of cooking equipment that is sensitive to temperature. When it gets too hot and the zooxanthellae don't cook well, the coral get rid of them and hope a new roommate will come along who can take the heat. This used to be a great way to deal with temperature change, but unfortunately it's gotten so hot recently that there are no more roommates nearby who can cook for the coral, and they die. \n\nMore in depth explanation:\nSo most reef building corals have a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, a photosynthetic organism. The corals keep the zooxanthellae safer than they would be in the ocean, and are able to provide them with some of the nutrients they need. In turn, zooxanthellae create most of the energy needed for the production of the reef. There are slow growing corals that live without zooxanthellae, but they grow even slower than reef coral. \n\nZooxanthellae species are adapted to very specific temperatures (this is true of many single celled photosynthetic organisms in the ocean). They also live free floating in the ocean as plankton. \n\nSo the hypothesis is that corals expel the zooxanthellae when they are stressed out, and new zooxanthellae will colonize the coral that function better in whatever the new water conditions are. This made coral great at dealing with change in the past, because there was usually a different zooxanthellae that could help them out. But now, this strategy is maladaptive, because there are no better zooxanthellae nearby. So what has helped keep coral alive for so long is actually no longer useful when temperatures get this high. \n\nAs others have pointed out, pollution and ocean acidification also contribute to coral reef decline. \n\nEdit: fixed the spelling, autocorrect blah blah",

      "380": "There are some reasonable answers here, but none of them capture the essential reason.  They all talk about the difference between AM and FM, but not why FM sounds better.  Here's an ELI5:\n\nCommercial FM radio sounds better because it gets more of the radio spectrum.  The reason it does is an accident of history.\n\nWhen a transmitter transmits radio waves, they go, well, everywhere.  It works by shaking electricity up and down in a rod (an antenna), and that sends out waves at a particular pitch.  If you want to think about it like sound, think of a tuning fork in a room, singing out at a particular pitch by moving air up and down.   Receivers contain tunable tuning forks that shake up and down in response to the waves that hit them.  \n\nRadio receivers then have to *decode* the shaking to create a signal.  AM radios measure how \"loud\" (strong) the incoming waves are, and use that strength to figure out where to place the speaker cone.  The transmitter makes its wave signal stronger and weaker very quickly, and that moves your speaker in and out very quickly, making sound.  FM radios measure the pitch of the incoming waves.  The transmitter adjusts its main tone slightly higher pitched, then lower again, and like that.  That makes the receiver move its speaker cone back and forth, and that makes sound. \n\nSo far so good, right?  Well, if there is more than one radio station around (hint: there are hundreds), they all work at slightly different pitches.  You adjust your receiver so it only resonates to one particular pitch, and then only one station gets received.  There's a whole branch of the government that sorts out whose radio transmitters are allowed to use which pitch (frequency).  Each station gets a range of radio spectrum it's allowed to use. \n\nSo here's the deal.  The lower the pitch, the less information there is in the signal!  Huh?  Well, if you have more than one radio station, you can't cram them too close together in pitch.   If the main pitches (the big kids call them  \"carrier frequencies\") of two different radio stations are too close to each other, then receivers can't tell the two stations apart, and the sound that comes out of each receiver will be a mix of the two stations.  So you have to separate the radio stations' carrier frequencies.  The amount you have to separate them in pitch is about four times the number of times per second your speaker cone has to move.  So if you want to transmit high pitched sound at, say, 10,000 vibrations per second, you have to keep your stations more than about 40,000 vibrations per second apart in pitch.  AM radios transmit between 600,000 and 1,600,000 wave fronts per second, which limits the number of stations you can fit in the radio band.  The difference between those two numbers is about a million vibrations per second, so you can fit about 25 stations into the band if everyone wants to broadcast moderately high fidelity sound.\n\nFM radios transmit at about 100,000,000 (100 million) wave fronts per second.  The band goes from 88 million to 108 million wave fronts per second.  The difference between those numbers is 20 million vibrations per second, so the FM band carries 20 times as much information in total as the AM band does. (thanks, /u/zed857!)\n\nInstead of adding more stations (you could fit nearly 400 AM radio stations into the FM band!) we cut up the band into larger chunks.  Since each station can transmit over a band 15 times wider than an AM station, it can send 15 times more information into your receiver.  The receivers use that in two ways:  (1) with FM coding, which reduces noise; and (2) to transmit stereo (which uses twice as much of the radio spectrum as mono) and higher frequency sound (which doublesthe spectrum usage again:  AM is actually limited at something like 7.5 kHz, and FM goes to 15 kHz).\n\nAM radio stations generally sound sort of washed-out and flat, because the highest pitch they can transmit is limited by the rules for radio transmission!  It's only about 7,500 cycles per second, which is not quite 4 octaves above middle C on the piano.  AM stations literally aren't allowed to transmit higher pitches than that. \n\nFM radio stations have clearer sound because they can transmit higher pitches (like the difference between a telephone and a CD), and also because they can use even more of the radio spectrum to reduce the amount of background noise in your receiver.\n\nAM came first because it's easier to make an electrical circuit that works a million times a second, than one that works at 100 million times a second.  Down in what we now call the AM band, there's just not a lot of room and technology like FM doesn't make much sense.  The whole AM band could only support about 5 FM radio stations operating at the same time.\n\nWhen radios that could operate at 100 million times a second became common, everyone settled on the FM standard instead of using the same AM technique that was useful earlier -- because there's plenty of \"room\" up there at 100 million cycles per second.\n\nIf an AM station had the same bandwidth as an FM station, it could transmit sound just as clear as FM(!)  But AM is more susceptible to some kinds of interference (like lightning or electric motors) -- so FM was the natural choice.\n",
      "381": "Here's how I reverse engineered it (and then reverse these steps back to see how it was first made). I'll use ~ to denote \"approximately\"\n\nThe trick basically says: \n\n227697( x^(1/2^19) -1) ~ log_10 x\n\nNatural logs are what you always want to work with, so I multiply both sides by ln 10, we get:\n\n524292 ( x^(1/2^19) -1) ~ ln x\n\nNow that constant in the front is very close to 2^19 = 524288, so we get to:\n\n2^19 ( x^(1/2^19) -1) ~ ln x\n\nDivide both sides by 2^19, and let u = x^(1/2^19):\n\nu - 1 ~ ln u\n\nwhich is true near u=1 (which can be seen by taking the tangent of ln u at u=1, or by Taylor series). For x < 1000, x^(1/2^19) is very close to 1, which is why this approximation is so good. \n\nIf you didn't need quite as many digits, you could similarly find appropriate constants to only have to recursively square root fewer than 19 times. For example, \n\n444.72 (x^(1/2^10) - 1) ~ log_10 x\n\nshould be a decent approximation as well. Written in terms of the steps in a hand calculator, it would be:\n\n1) Recursively square root 10 times\n2) Subtract 1\n3) Multiply by 444.72\n\nThis gives you 2 dp accuracy for x < 10, which is all you need for the approximation anyway because we can apply the identity:\n\nlog_10 (a * 10^n ) = n + log_10 a\n\nSo e.g. log_10 (724) = 2 + log_10 (7.24). The approximation with 10 recursively square roots gives the correct result to 2dp.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards pals, appreciate them all :) \n\nAnother note - by tweaking OPs constant of 227697 to 227695, we can go from 4dp accuracy to 6dp accuracy!

      "385": "The reason phone calls don't have perfect audio has all to do with three things.\n\n* Bandwidth\n* Physical medium of the delivery technology\n* The codec used\n\nThey are all closely related.\n\nIf you think of a data connection as a water pipe, there is only so much data that can be passed down the connection, just like a water pipe can only carry so many gallons of water a second.\n\nIf you make the water pipe bigger, the pipe can carry more gallons a second and deliver more water faster to its source. This is broadly comparable to using better connectivity for our data connections. For example fibre optic cable can carry much more data a lot faster than the copper cables that are used to connect most of our homes.\n\nTo that end, when a phone conversation is initiated between two people, the sound of the voices from each party is in fact, a data connection that gets converted into an analogue frequency. Now uncompressed audio takes up a lot of space and can be slow to transfer, so to reduce it down to something more manageable, phone systems use something called a CODEC (en*CO*de/*DEC*ode) that basically analyses the audio, and throws out the bits of data that it thinks is not relevant to the clarity of the conversation. The more data it throws out, the more \"AM Radio\" the conversation sounds.\n\nThe standard codec used by most public telephone systems (Generally known as the \"PSTN\" to phone engineers or \"Public Switched Telephone Network\") is something called U-LAW. Europe uses a variation of it called A-LAW. It allows 64Kbp/s of data for each way of the conversation (So 128Kbp/s total). It's been around since the 70's and is fairly embedded into most phone systems. It also closely matched and fitted the best data rate offered by twisted copper connections that where used at the time (And predominantly still are).\n\nThe days of the \"AM radio\" phone call are coming to an end though, if quite slowly.\n\nMany new codecs have been developed alongside newer communications technology since the 70's that allow for greater clarity in a phone conversation. They do this by improved methods of packing in the audio data and more sophisticated ways of deciding what parts of the audio need to be thrown away and what needs to be kept. Some are even able to do this using a smaller transfer speed than the U-LAW codec. Most of these improved quality codecs are referred to as wideband codecs or \"HD audio\". This has come about with the rise of a technology called VOIP or \"Voice Over IP\" which is basically a phone system that utilizes the same technology that underpins the internet (TCP/IP) to deliver an all digital phone service.\n\nOne of the most popular codecs used by internal phone systems of companies/organizations (Which is sometimes referred to as a PBX or Private Branch Exchange) is a codec called G722. The difference in audio quality between G722 and U-LAW is like night and day.\n\nCellular technology is also catching up on the wideband conversation game. Indeed many mobile carriers are offering wideband calls between users on the same network. This uses a codec called AMR-WB. It's generally predicted within ten years or so wideband audio for mobile phone calls will become the norm **where supported**.\n\nI emphasise that \"Where supported\" bit because like most communication methods, a phone call has to negotiate down to the level of the lowest offering. So if a phone conversation is initiated between two phone systems, one side tries to use a wideband codec like G722 and the other side only supports U-LAW, then both phones will use U-LAW and the conversation will return to the \"AM Radio\" quality for both callers.",

A disorder is a maladaptive response to what we consider the norm. When you have an anxiety disorder, you chronically react too much or have difficulty to come back to a normal state.\n\nAnxiolytics (for benzodiazepines, most commonly used) work on your central nervous system by making your neurons less excitable, this is extremely useful to calm you down during a panic attack or in prevention when you have to confront a stressful event. Your muscles respond less to the accelerator, your heart calms down, you breathe slower, your muscles relax. Unfortunately, this is highly addictive and just treat your physical symptoms.\n\nDepression is a low mood state, a temporary inability to feel excited or joy. It is normal to feel that way. What we consider not normal it's when this state last for more than 6 months or is accompanied with worthless feelings and/or suicidal thoughts. Your antidepressants medications will help you having more good feeling molecules in your brain, helping you a get through the rough events you are going through. However, this takes time to have an effect and this will make your brain produce or recapture less of these molecules (this is why you need progressive withdrawal and develop tolerance).\n\nDepression and anxiety are commonly seen together. A lot of anxious persons develops depression states or juggle with both disorders. We do not know exactly all the mechanisms, different theories going on.

A customer can be 100% wrong in their interaction with a business. You could ban that customer or simply ask him or her to leave. However, when they go out into the world and recount their experience to their friends and family, those people will only hear the customer's side of the story. You as a business owner don't get a seat at they table to explain what actually happened. This can easily dissuade other people from visiting your business and buying from you. \n\nSo it often makes sense to placate a customer who is not \"right.\" That customer leaves satisfied and may even realize later upon further reflection that he was being a jerk. If he ever recounts his experience to another person, his story is now unequivocally positive. \"Man I was super pissed off the other day after a long day at work. Went to Mike's tacos, and I accidentally ordered the wrong thing. When the waitress brought it I was kind of snotty and told her she better fix it.

If light hits anywhere in the square it gets measured and makes that spot in the image lighter.\n\nStars are much much much much smaller than one square, but they put out so much light that it's still enough to register as a white spot in the image.\n\nSo we know the star is actually somewhere within that square (pixel) but there is no way to know where inside of the square it is.

      "420": "CJK Type designer here. \n\n**1) Limited character set**\nAs others have indicated, thankfully no one has to actually design millions of characters. Actual glyph coverage depends on the needs of the font. Let's look at Microsoft as a sample (including Latin & other symbol characters). \n\nChinese (Trad / Simplified): 30,000 characters. \nJapanese: 24,000 characters\nKorean: 21,000 characters\n\nNow, the above includes a lot of glyphs that most people probably don't need. In the case of Korean, the most basic fonts can have just around 3,000 characters (just Hangul and Latin, no Hanja) and work for most scenarios. For Japanese, there’s 48 Katakana, 48 Hiragana, and about 3000 core Kanji (for literacy), which would cover a majority of scenarios. But for a company like Microsoft, a greater degree of support is necessary. \n\n**2) Accelerated and Semi-accelerated tools**\nIn the case of Korean typefaces, there are tools that help expedite the development of Hangul characters. As Korean syllable glyphs are divided up into component pieces, one can instruct the tool on where to place those components and which variant of each component to use. For some fonts there are 40+ variants of each component! With this sort of tool, building can be faster. But it won't always work for a given situation and then the work has to be done by hand. \n\nIn some Japanese foundries, there is something of an ‘toolkit’ that is used with examples of the different kinds of strokes necessary for Kanji. So the digitizer (more on that later) can just drag in the one that is appropriate for a given glyph. However, as each glyph is different, there’s still quite a bit of manual tweaking necessary from there.\n\nPart of the problem with Japanese and Chinese is, like with Korean, there’s significant manual adjustment of a given radical or stroke for every character. So even if a tool was able to at least ‘assemble’ the pieces into a given glyph, you’d have to make significant manual adjustments from there. \n\n**3) It takes an army**\nI heard a story from a friend of mine who visited a Chinese foundry. Designers would pull a Hanzi from a hat and that would be the character they have to produce. With an army of 30 people working on a single font, they’d churn through the characters until the font was complete. \n\nIn one major Japanese foundry, there is a division of labor—“designers” draw the characters on paper, “digitizers” trace those drawings to digital representation, “production” takes the digital representations and produces actual fonts. All told, it is a significant operation involving a large group of people. It takes them a year to complete a single weight (say, the “Regular”) of a brand new font family.\n\nProducing these things is a TON OF WORK. \n\nA quick aside about Korean—given the existence of accelerated tools for production, these *can* be done faster than Japanese or Chinese fonts, but the best ones usually have manual edits and tweaking on an extensive number, if not all of the syllables. One Korean type designer I spoke to warned me about the use of accelerated tools—that the actual results from it are not that great. He, obviously, recommended doing everything by hand. \n\n\n\n\n**Basically:**\n\n1) It may not be as many characters as you think it is\n2) There are some tools for accelerating work, though a lot is still manual\n3) Usually the work is done by a group of people, over a period of time, rather than by an individual. \n\nGot more questions?

      "421": "Simplest Explaintion I coud find - \n  \nAll plants can sense the direction of the gravitational field and orientate themselves accordingly. This is called geotaxis. In mature plants, phototaxis (growing towards the light source) overrides the gravitational impulse for the stalk and leaves, but the roots - and the seed while it is underground - rely on gravity for orientation. \n  \nThe mechanism is thought to be based on either the protoplasm (the living substance inside a cell) exerting a greater pressure on the cell walls at the bottom, or starch grains within the cells settling at the bottom. One or both of these cues influence the production of plant growth hormones that cause the plant to 'steer' as it grows.\n  \n[Source](http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/how-do-seeds-know-which-way-grow)\n  \n*Details for nerd 5 years old*\n  \nA bunch of other commenters have mentioned that plants can sense gravity, but nobody's explained how! The answer is that they have starchy components (amyloplasts) in some of their cells that are heavier than the cytoplasm, making them sediment at the bottom of the cell. A hormonal growth signal then emanates in the direction of the part of the cell where the amyloplasts accumulate (i.e. down).\n  \nYou can see this for yourself by tipping over a fast-growing potted plant. The side of the stem facing down will grow faster, causing the shoot to gradually bend upright again. Plants use the same mechanism - uneven distribution of growth hormones in response to sensory input - when they grow toward light, etc.\n  \n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4lmi3q/how_does_a_plant_seed_know_which_way_is_up/d3pe6nj/)",

The playground at Hull House had swings, sand piles, hammocks, and a maypole, and the motivation for creating these spaces was to promote socialization and to keep children safe and out of the streets.\n\nAs to why we see certain standardized pieces in playgrounds, it appears to have evolved into its current form with ever-growing safety concerns:\n>The “standardized playground” era... reflected the design and redesign of manufactured playground equipment, primarily the four S’s -swings, slides, see-saws, superstructures, and the prevalence of surrounding hard surfaces typically seen on American playgrounds throughout much of the 20th century. During the 1970’s and 1980’s standardizing playground equipment developed simultaneously with concerns about playground injuries, increasing lawsuits, and formation of task forces to prepare national standards for playground equipment safety (Kutska, 2011).

These atoms are held in place by a magnetic field, and are kept at very cold temperatures to make sure nothing interferes with them. The atoms are all negatively charged, meaning they all have one extra electron than they normally would like to have.\n\nTo fully understand time crystals, you must know a bit about electrons. Electrons have a property called \"spin\". Spin just describes how an electron likes to orbit around the nucleus of an atom. A fundamental understanding would be thinking about this like how earth orbits the sun, but also rotates on it's axis at the same time. So, in the way the earth orbits the sun so do electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom. The way that they \"rotate\" on their axis is their spin. There are two types of spin: up and down. \n\n**(This is of course not exactly how spin works, but is good for a fundamental understanding)\n\nNow, remember that we have a circle of atoms in a nice, stable environment, all given an extra electron. A laser is then used to make the extra electron of each atom spin either up or down. The researchers \"spun\" the atoms in alternating order, with the idea that this would create a never-ending cycle of spin oscillations. One atom would cause the next to change direction of it's spin, and so on and so on forever. \n\nWhat was discovered was that the rate of spin oscillation (flipping from up to down) took twice as long as expected. This is considered the proof that the crystal was affected by time.\n\nPractical benefits to humanity are pretty much for computing.

      "429": "Edit: I wrote my original answer in response to OP's question, but there still seems to be a lot of confusion. It might help if I write a bit of a summary about what gravitational waves actually *are*, and I'm adding that to the top here:\n\n**What are gravitational waves?** **What is LIGO?**\n\n- In Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, gravity isn't just a \"force\" that pulls objects. Instead, you can think of space as like a sort of fabric, and that a large object will put a dent in the fabric, causing other objects to move in bent paths as they move through the bent fabric. You've probably seem [images like this](http://i.imgur.com/lP0Bnii.jpg) before, though this is a loose metaphor, and you shouldn't take it too seriously.\n\n- Gravitational waves are a \"wave\" in this fabric. Like any fabric, a big jolt will cause a shock to flow along it. Something like [colliding black holes](https://youtu.be/FXlg3cr-q44?t=29) will do it.\n\n- A gravitational wave is a wave of *stretching* and *contracting*. Along the wave, space gets squished and unsquished again. A circular object becomes [a little bit oval](http://i.imgur.com/asNxPe4.gif) This effect is very very small - it's happening all the time and we don't notice it.\n\n- We built machines that fires lasers over several kilometres to measure tiny changes in that distance, to detect the tiny effects of gravitational waves. It's so sensitive, it can measure changes in length down to less than the size of a proton. They built two in opposite corners of the US, but there are other ones being built around the world. The American ones recently got an upgrade. The American machines are called LIGO, and they've now been upgraded to \"Advanced LIGO\".\n\n- And these upgraded machines actually detected gravitational waves!\n\n- We've had a long time to think about what pattern of wibbles a gravitational wave from colliding black holes should look like, and it turns out the waves we found look exactly like what we were expecting! Even more specifically, we can say how big these black holes were, and about how far away they were - about 30x the mass of our Sun each, and about billion light years away.\n\n\n----\n\n**And then, to answer the original question: why is this important?**\n\nTwo big things!\n\nFirstly, General Relativity has always predicted that gravitational waves should exist. However, they are very weak, and even the most sensitive detectors should only detect the most dramatic ones - the \"chirp\" of gravitational waves that comes from the merger of two neutron stars, or even better, two black holes.\n\nRecently, the LIGO detectors have been upgraded so that they finally have the sensitivity to detect the strongest of gravitational waves. And a few months ago, both sets of detectors (one in Louisiana, one in Washington state) detected a [chirp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqhUANNFXw) of gravitational waves, fitting exactly the pattern of frequencies you'd expect from the merger of two black holes about a billion light years away with a mass of about 30x our Sun each.\n\n**This detection is a massive confirmation of General Relativity**. It would be worrying if we didn't detect anything, but this really confirms that our understanding of gravity and the universe is correct.\n\nSecondly, this opens up an entirely new field of observational astronomy. Astronomy works mostly through telescopes that observe different types of light waves - visible light, infrared, x-rays, radio waves, etc. But gravitational waves are an entirely different thing, and they give us a wholly new point of view on the universe, letting us see things we couldn't see otherwise.\n\nFor example, something that's 30x the mass of our Sun is a pretty small object to see at a distance of a billion light years! Black holes are also really really small (these are like 90 km across). So we detected something less than 100 km across that was a billion light years away! And that's something that would be pretty much impossible to do with any other current method.\n\n**It really is a wholly new window into the universe.**\n",

      "438": "Some animals like hydra, sea anemone and planaria are capable of total regeneration because they have special cells, called stem cells, that can refresh themselves and every other cell type in the animal. This means that the animal can constantly regenerate itself, so its cells don't accumulate damage and don't exhibit other signs of aging (like humans do).\n\nOther animals (like humans) aren't so fortunate because we don't make the awesome cocktail of signals that direct hydra/anemone/planaria cells to be so awesome. \n\nHowever, no animal is immortal. Hydra, anemone, and planaria can die if they get an injury that they can't recover from. This is because the signals that direct stem cells to form a specific part of the body are in a gradient that is usually from head to tail, so if you slice a planaria in half from head to tail, it won't be able to recover and it will die. \n\nLikewise, if ALL the stem cells get destroyed (like by radiation), the animal will die. However, if even one stem cell survives, that cell will be able to replicate and restore the regenerative ability of the organism. \n\nSo it all comes down to regeneration: some animals can do it because they have the right gradient of signals throughout their lifetime, and other animals can't do it because they only have those signals in that specific gradient when they are embryos.\n\nEDIT: I stand corrected! It appears that planaria will be able to recover from any bisection, whether vertical, horizontal, or zig zag. Thank you all for your polite contributions. \n\nTo everyone asking about mutations and cancer, planaria can get cancer, but they have a small(er) and tightly regulated genome that prevents harmful mutations from cropping up. Additionally, most mutations that happen-statistically speaking-are synonymous, which means that they don't affect the planaria's ability to live and thrive normally. Planaria have been studied under the effects of carcinogenic agents (things that cause cancer), though, so it's certainly possible for them to develop cancers and teratomas.\n\nTo everyone asking about the implication of stem cell in humans, I encourage you to google stem cell research + whatever condition you're interested in (ex: diabetes)! There's so much being done currently with stem cells, though there are a lot of controversial opinions surrounding this research. There are a lot of hopeful outcomes, though!\n\nTo everyone asking why we didn't evolve to regenerate, I would probably say that the cost of regeneration (increased probability of developing cancer) is too high to overcome.\n\nWishing you all a very Merry Christmas, or whatever holiday you celebrate!

This is normal for anyone since you don't want the house to freeze, so everyones body has some fat stores to burn on hand.  \n\nBut Being obese \\ fat is like bringing more and more wood in than you can burn constantly. Eventually you are building addition after addition on to that house, but only in order to stock the more and more wood inside you keep bringing. Time passes until you could last month's without getting more wood, stacked to the rafters in every room and corridor where it can go.\n\nIntermittent fasting would be like focusing on burning the wood you have in the house first and only bringing more in at the end of the day.

It's made easier to have less calories since your restricting based on time, it's harder to get them in. \n\nMonths pass, Your additions get smaller and smaller, and even if you want to bring more in you can't fit it. This is because your stomach volume shrinks over the hours it remains empty, and it's harder to eat thousands of calories in the little time you have with a smaller stomach.\n\nIn time, the additions get emptied little by little, and the amount of wood you bring in becomes more manageable and normal because you simply aren't used to carrying in an over abundance anymore, both physically and mentally. \n\nI lost 100lbs on intermittent fasting, starting from 400+ to my 305 now.

There's a sort of race among the plants to grow fastest (to soak up all of the water while there still is some).  Then, the plants bloom in March/April, when we get the first few hot days (and the water is finally all gone).  After that, the vegetation all dies back, leaving just the root structure alive.  As the summer progresses, this becomes more and more complete.  By July/August, very, *very* little is still green in the wilderness areas.\n\nThen, the summer is extremely hot, with temperatures exceeding 100 F, and humidity falling sometimes as low as 6-7%.  These super-hot, extra-dry days usually coincide with a local wind condition (the \"Santa Ana winds\" -- a type of [Adiabatic wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabatic_wind)) which brings gusty winds that are erratic and sometimes blow at near-hurricane-force.\n\nIn these conditions, *any* ignition source is extremely likely to become a wildfire, as an ember landing anywhere will ignite some brush, and the winds will whip new embers off in an erratic path to land amongst more fuel.\n\nThe result is a raging wildfire front that often moves at 20mph+, consumes most everything in its path, and periodically starts new fires up to 2 miles away as embers escape.\n\nAdditionally, much of the wildland areas are extremely rugged, mountainous terrain, which aids the fire in spreading (the winds just fly down any channels or canyons) and also severely hamper firefighters, as the fire can quickly move over an impassible-to-humans ridge, requiring lots of time for ground crews to catch up.",
      "447": "To keep it really simple:\n\nLets say I own a large company in the US called XYZ Records America which records and sells music albums online.\n\nYou buy an album from me online for $10 (+state taxes which come out of your pocket, not mine). Lets assume that on average it costs me $0.50/album to record and produce the album, $0.50/album to maintain the servers and site, and $1/album in royalties to the artist.\nFor each album, I get $10 in revenue, and have $2 of expenses, for $8 of profit.\n\nCorporate income tax is only paid on the profit my company makes, so I pay the tax rate on $8. Lets assume it's 25%, which means I'll have to pay $2 in tax. Now my net profit is only $6.\n\nAs a corporation, my primary goal is to increase profits. More profits = more money for me, more expansion for the company, more jobs or better pay for my employees, more charitable donations, etc. No matter what my philosophy is, it's almost always driven by more profits.\n\n* $0.50/album goes to recording. Maybe I can negotiate this down, but that means paying my workers less and that wont make them happy.\n\n* $0.50/album goes to server management. Maybe I can outsource my servers to Asia for a better rate but at a customer service loss.\n\n* $1.00/album to the artist. Maybe I can skim them for more next album, but they could always sign with someone else.\n\n* I could also sell the album for more, but then that could hurt sales, and the artist would want more.\n\n* $2.00/album is taxed. It's already the biggest factor in my profits, and if I were to shave costs elsewhere, this would go up.\n\nIt's obvious in this example that the most effective way to increase profits is to pay less tax.\n\nSo what do I do? I send my accountants on a quest to find an answer, and they come back to me with the information that Ireland's corporate tax is only 10% instead of the 25% I pay here. So what do I do? Well I could move the company there, but there's a lot of assets in the US. I don't want to relocate the studios, servers, etc. I'll lose business if I do that.\n\nInstead, lets just found XYZ Records Ireland. I'll structure my brand so that they're the \"Parent Company\" of XYZ Records America.\nAll of the licenses XYZ Records America owns, I'll \"sell\" to them for $0.01 each. \nWhen I record a new album in the U.S. I can immediately sell the rights to XYZ Ireland for $0.01.\n\nNow I still want to *sell* the albums in the US to the same customers. So when you go to my online store and buy a record from XYZ America, I'll sell it to you for $10 just the same. You won't see a difference.\n\nWhen I do that though, XYZ America will account for:\n\n* $0.50/album towards recording - this covers the operating expenses for producing the album.\n\n* $0.50/album towards server management - this keeps the site up and running\n\n* $1.00/album royalties to the artist\n\n* and lastly $8.00 in licensing fees paid to XYZ Ireland.\n\nMy revenue was $10, my total expenses were $10, \"damn, the company didn't make any money\". No profits to report, and 25% tax on $0 is $0 to pay in tax.\nI end up paying no tax in America. \n\nI still have to report my income in Ireland though.\nSo per album sold in America, XYZ Ireland's books look like this:\n\n* $8.00 revenue from licensing fees (Paid by XYZ America to XYZ Ireland).\n\n* $0.05 in operating costs to keep XYZ Ireland operating (I have an office to pay rent in, and a few employees there)\n\nXYZ Records Ireland reports $7.95 of profits per album. The tax on that is 10% of $7.95, so I'll pay $0.795 = $0.80.\nNet profit is $7.15 per album.\n\nBy opening a parent company in Ireland, I can now earn $1.15 extra per album.\nI pay $0 to the US government in taxes, and I pay less tax overall.\n\nIf I sell 1,000,000 albums every year, that's $2,000,000 that the US Government no longer receives from me, and it's $1,150,000 of extra profits for the company.\n\n\n\n",

Spanish hasn't had really much of anything quite so disruptive happen - it's been more a long series of much smaller changes. On the attitude side of things, English speakers have made a huge deal out of the concept of 'spelling things right', to the point that major change is largely unthinkable at this point - too many people have too strong of feelings about the current spelling system. (This might also be due in part to English's more major sound changes! It would take a massive reform to update English spelling, and it would have even if the reform had happened in 1600, thanks to the above-mentioned Great Vowel Shift - updating to account for even just that change would require a major change. Spanish on the other hand has largely been able to get by on a rolling series of small tweaks.)\n\nPlus, now English has different standard dialects in different places, and it would be impossible to achieve a Spanish-like level of one(ish)-to-one(ish) letter-to-sound correspondences in all dialects simultaneously without having different spellings per dialect.\n\nFor some other examples, compare Tibetan - which has a worse spelling-to-pronunciation correspondence than English does - and Swedish and Norwegian, where Swedish has much less predictable spelling than Norwegian despite them being basically dialects of the same language (from a purely linguistic perspective). Norwegian has gone through a series of language reforms (not confined only to spelling) since Norway's independence from Denmark in 1814, in part as a way of asserting a separate linguistic identity from Danish; Swedish just hasn't ever had the same impetus to change. Tibetan went through a drastic change somewhat like English did, where several kinds of previous consonant distinctions got turned into tone distinctions all in one go; I suspect that's also part of why Tibetan hasn't been updated.",

I’ll just focus on the first two, because that’s what most people are concerned about.  \n\n\nThe root of most acne lies in the hair follicle.  Your skin produces oils called sebum to lubricate your hair and skin.  These pores can become clogged and produce comedones (which are your “blackheads” or “whiteheads” depending on whether the comedone surface has been oxidized by the air).  If you want to treat comedonal acne, you need to use a topical retinoid (which is a derivative of Vitamin A) and this will interfere with sebum production.\n\n\nNow in other cases, these plugged pores can become a site where bacteria take up residence, and this leads to pustules, papules, cysts.  This is inflammatory acne.  At that point, you need to add an antibiotic or two along with a retinoid to attack both problems.  So you really need a doctor to classify what type of acne you have before you can figure out what treatments you need.\n\n\nMost people have acne in their teenage years because they have higher levels of steroid hormones (e.g. estrogen or testosterone) which promote sebum production and the development of comedones.  As their hormone levels stabilize through puberty, sebum production will level off.  I’ll leave it to the dermatologists to tell you the best ways care for your skin.  But aside from medications, you want to keep your skin clean and moisturized at a level where you’re not allowing sebum to build up, but your skin is also not too dry and cracked that your skin bacteria can invade and cause inflammatory acne.  Finding the balance can be difficult.",

      "469": "EDIT 2, ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: Thank you so much for my first ever Reddit gold, stranger. You guys in the comments have all been awesome. <3\n\nYour phone can \"feel\" how hard it has to push and pull against what's plugged into the aux jack. It moves the speaker in your headphones out with a push of electrons and then it pulls back to pull it in. Do this fast or slow and you have a frequency, and do it in very specific timing and you're vibrating just like someone's vocal cords, or the string on an instrument, or a combination of those.\n\nAux in your car is different like they said. See, instead of talking directly to a tiny easy to push speaker in headphones your car has really big intimidating speakers and your phone is really apprehensive about a job that big. So instead it talks to a middle manager in the stereo called an amplifier who listens to your phone and they and their friends in the stereo do the job of pushing and pulling themselves, making things really really easy on your phone. There's basically no pushing and pulling happening at all!\n\nYour phone keeps track of how hard it is to push or pull something so it doesn't hurt itself or do something really rude like shout in an amplifier's ear because they're friends and friends don't do that. Nowadays phones are clever enough that they remember how loud that pushing and pulling should be for those two friends instead of forgetting every time it changes. It's important to note that the volume (amplitude) of the pushing and pulling is different than how hard it is to do the work. Think pushing and pulling two boxes the same size the same distance at the same speed, but one box is empty and the other is full of rocks. Someone watching wouldn't know it, but your arms sure feel the difference! The phone's the same way pushing and pulling that signal through the wire.\n\nHope that helps~\n\nEDIT: Some have clarified that the phone is not measuring impedance and I'm here to say you're absolutely right! Top comment has a somewhat half right answer. If you liked my ELI5 above be ready for something more like an ELI12 below.\n\nSo, impedance is the friction, the squeeze, the resistance to a flow of electricity. Specifically when you're pushing and pulling back and forth instead of going one way all the time. You've probably heard something along the lines of batteries are DC and your house is AC at some point in your life. This gets somewhat complicated so we're going to do the subject a disservice by leaving it really simple and saying DC only cares about how much resistance, or friction if we're using a pushing boxes across the floor metaphor, in that circuit or pathway to it's destination. Impedance is more complicated, it's that friction on the floor but it's also invisible things that interfere and slow us down. Radio, magnetic fields, it's hard to really give a good basic explanation that really illustrates what our push and pull signal are going to go through but we'll say some environments are windy in the place you're pushing the box. Sometimes it's at your back, your front, or your side and that can all have an impact on what your pushing and pulling looks like so you need to work hard to make sure that the receiver of your signal sees what you want them to. This extra work, and the work in general, is the load. The load is a measurement of how much power it's taking to do the thing you're trying to do. A really rough road that rubs on your box a lot and high winds and you're working really hard. A really slick road and no wind and you're flying that box across the ground with ease. Now, we don't really have the measuring instruments to say exactly how rough the winds and road are, but we do know how much power we're putting in to work. That's load monitoring. We could probably make a really good guess what the impedance of our environment is now that we know how far and how fast to shift the box around as well as how much power we're putting in to do it but we don't need to. We can continue to leave that variable unknown because all we need are the other two.\n\nFor the budding engineers:\nWe'll assume we're converting our impedance to equivalent resistance because it makes the demonstration easier. Load monitoring is not finding R in V=IR, rather it's monitoring our circuit for I. Now, obviously, we could calculate R since we now monitor and know V and I at any given time but there's really no need to. We don't need to monitor R so long as we have a threshold for I to prevent damage in case of a short. Which we really need to do, because a TRS stereo mini connector shorts the output lines every time it's pulled in or pushed out. That's that really obnoxious *crackle, pop!* that happens when you pull the jack that goes to your speakers. So now, since we have a bunch of really cool integrated circuits that have started to cost pennies to put in phones we don't just shunt a shorted load. We monitor it and have a couple thresholds, a short condition that tells the phone to cut power to the amp and pause playback because the headphones were removed/inserted, a value range associated with being connected directly to an amp, and a value range associated with being connected to headphones.",

As a result, there is no entrance to the box either. The only way the charge can get into the box is to kind of \"teleport\" through the wall of the box using a process known as Quantum Tunneling.

Answer was also made in context of a question, when destileries switched from drinking alcohol to hand sanitizer, all they did was change proportions and added some stuff. They did not suddenly change to producing isopropyl alcohol.\n\n---\n\n**ELI5**: Most hand sanitizers use Ethanol - same alcohol that's present in vodka, wine and beer, they do use special mix of 60-80% of ethanol in a solution, with extra additives that make it better for your hands.

What gives? Taxes. Alcohol after gasoline is one of the most taxed substances. But hand sanitizer is usually exempt.\n\nBut then what would stop people from just drinking hand sanitizer for a cheaper thrill?\n\nAdditives.

They grow in later stages too, early childhood birthmarks and late adulthood birthmarks are common.\n\n2nd part not so much since there are many types. We classify them in to 2 types: vascular and pigmentational. Vascular birthmarks occur if blood vessels in a particular area of your skin don’t form the way they should. For example, there may be too many blood vessels clustered in one area or the blood vessels may be wider than they should be. Pigmented birthmarks occur when there’s an overabundance of pigment cells in one area. Pigment cells are what give your skin its natural color.\n\nEdit1: So a lot of people asked about inverse or white birthmarks. As far as I know that is called depigmentation or in extreme cases vitiligo. It is mostly the same cause as the normal birthmark and quite common.\n\nEdit1: In my first comment I didn't know what causes birthmarks. Since then I've been enlightened. It is caused by a hereditary type of mutation that is actually a BENIGN skin tumor in the making.\n\nEdit1: Birthmarks are hereditary, just like everything else. You give or receive half of your genome, therefore what your parents have you and your children are more likely to have the same. This goes for birthmarks, breast cancer, arthritis and even stuff like alcoholism.\n\nEdit2: Birthmark is an improper term. We use nevus in medicine. The popular term suggests that it is in fact formed at birth and nothing else. That is factually untrue. They form arround birth most of the time, but many form in later stages of life too. The example of improper terminology I've been using in the comments is this: pineapple has nothing to do with pines and a bit with apples, jusy like birthmark has nothing to do with the actual procces of giving birth but a bit with when the mark usually forms.",

When he returned to Norway, he told Tryggvason that the Icelanders were refusing to accept the new religion, the king threatened war and there were genuine fears that Iceland would soon be engulfed in civil war.\n\nThings came to a head because of the actions of a Christian convert, Hjalti Skeggjason who had been sentenced for mocking the goddess Freyja. He was allowed to serve his sentence in Norway along with his father-in-law. During their exile, they got the backing of Tryggvason and on their return raised an army that threatened to trigger the war in Iceland.\n\nSo, the matter was referred to the Icelandic parliament for arbitration. Iceland was a form of democracy where individual chiefs gathered at the Althing located at the site of Thingvellir a little to the East of modern Reykjavik.

The major way people die from electric shocks is if it goes through the heart. Your heart is a finely tuned machine that does not appreciate a sudden external signal saying contract all muscles. If you're lucky, your heart resumes beating with its normal pattern. If not, hope someone around knows CPR.\n\nIncidentally, this is also a bugbear for medical shows - the device with the paddles and the shouting clear doesn't restart the heart, it stops the heart and is used when the rhythm has gone wrong (called fibrillation). The heart can then restart itself with the correct rhythm (hopefully).\n\nEdit: thanks to the 5000 electricians who have correctly pointed out that devices exist for checking if a circuit is live. Use a device if you have one (and if you haven't got one, why are you working on your electrics?). The only time that tip saved by bacon was when I found an unknown wire in my loft.

For instance, protein is typically measured using the Kjeldahl or Dumas method, which does measure the nitrogen in food then uses a conversion factor to get from nitrogen to protein.

Therefore, once you drink a liquid supersaturated with CO2, bubbles form in all your nooks and crannies in your mouth (nucleation sites), and physically make that stinging sensation.\n\nOf course, this is amplified by the fact that CO2 dissolves in water to a slightly acidic solution of carbonic acid, so your tongue also feels the acidity as the liquid hits your mouth. N2, being inert and neutral, does not give the same taste.",
      "526": "Imagine a cell is like a car. The goal of antibacterials, antibiotics, alcohol, etc. is to disable that car. There are two basic ways to do it, delicate and brute force. You could, for example, cut the ignition wire so the car wont start, but a manufacturer can move the wire someplace so you cant see it. This is how antibiotics work, they target specific parts of a cell, and sometimes cells can hide these parts.\n\nThe other way to disable a car, however, is to just blow it the fuck up. Sure the manufacturer can put armor on it, but at the end of the day a big enough explosion is gonna get the job done, however, you're going to have collateral damage. This is how alcohol and fire work, they obliterate everything, there is no way for a cell to adapt to them any more than you can adapt to surviving an explosion. For this same reason, however, we can't use these methods internally because they cause too much collateral damage. Would injecting ethanol into your blood stream kill bacteria? Probably, but it will kill a whole lot of other important cells first.\n\n**Edit: Since people are asking questions;**\n\nI guess I didn't directly answer the original question and in short, no you're not. The 1% of bacteria that survive such treatments do so because they hide in little cracks and crevices in your mouth so they aren't exposed to the Listerine rather than they have evolved some resistance to it. I would, however, like to point out some bacteria have evolved resistances to low levels of ethanol (yeast for example) and other antibiotics, but none can tolerate higher levels just like an armored vehicle can survive a small explosion but not a large one.\n\nTo stick with our car metaphor alcohol kills cells partially by denaturing proteins, which is equivalent to taking apart the engine, and by solvating the cell membrane, which is the same as removing the fame of the car (although technically that is a cytoskeleton in a cell, maybe doors and windows is a better parallel, but you could still drive your car then). Good luck getting anywhere without those.\n\nThe reason the other cells in your mouth aren't killed (and many actually are) is your cells are part of an organism as opposed to an individual bacterium. This has the benefit of reducing the exposure/surface area cells have to the environment (the listerine) as well as cells not exposed can help out cells that are maintain their internal chemistry.\n\nAnd finally, I guess there are treatments where ethanol is injected directly into the blood stream. I learned something too. Woo.\n\n**Edit 2:** A few people have asked me why hand soap and other sanitizes are different and as far as I am aware they aren't (although living an extremely clean lifestyle will reduce your immunity to things). I'd like to note I haven't seen a study linking the use of hand soap to an increase in the number of harmful bacteria, just anecdotal evidence and some theories, but I have seen one that says normal soap is as good at getting rid of bacteria as antibacterial soap so that's something to think about.\n\nI believe the confusion stems from what I consider ultimate antibacterial properties and safe ones (I made these terms up they're not scientific). That is to say ultimate antibacterials kill everything, good cells, bad cells, whatever and alcohol is both an ultimate and average antibacterial depending on its concentration. When people talk about bacteria evolving resistances to antibacterials they mean at levels which are safe for good cells, our cells and naturally occurring bacteria rather than a complete and total resistance as can be developed to something like penicillin. Penicillin marks a very specif portion of very specific kinds of cells so your body will attack them. Bacteria are getting really good at hiding that part of their cell.\n\nTo put it another way, a cell may evolve a resistance to moderate heat but will never to extreme heat because at certain temperatures molecular bonds simply break down. There are bacteria which have evolved to live in extreme ranges of temperature, hundreds of degrees on any scale, but even these have their limits. No bacterium we are aware of can live on the surface of the sun, or even evolve to, but that doesn't help keep us kill them since using the surface of the sun to kill the bad cells would also kill the good ones.",

What is happening is actually a solubility between two nonpolar solid substances, the rubber and the graphite. So, the London dispersion forces (really weak intermolecular forces) between these molecules are attracted to each other and as you rub and use energy(very minimal energy) to break apart the graphite layers there is increased surface area for the graphite from the paper to \"stick\" onto the eraser. That's why you get dirty rubber dust.\n\nThat's also why your lead sticks to paper to begin with, those same London dispersion forces are attracting the lead to the paper. It is also, as others have pointed out, due to particles of the graphite getting lodged into the tiny, tiny holes in the paper. ☺\n\n\n\nEdit: I was so excited I forgot to answer your question completely. Erasers are made out of rubber because it is a nonpolar solid material which attracts other nonpolar solids, like graphite. The way it is malleable and crumbles (like others mentioned) makes it less abrasive to the paper itself. \n\nEdit 3: Thanks for the gold!! Can someone ELI5 to me what I do with it?!

      "533": "Okay, so so far, none of these are really ELI5. Here's the easiest I can do.\n\nThink of a piece of paper with 256 lines or 512 lines (imagine it's double the paper), etc. Pieces of paper here always have 256 lines, 512 lines, etc (power of 2s). Always. \n\nSo you can buy sheets of paper with 256 lines, 512 lines, etc. Except your question is, why is it being sold as 250 lines, 500 lines, or 240 lines, 480 lines?\n\nComputer memory is exactly the same, replacing \"lines\" with \"GB\". Hard drives have 256 GB, 512 GB, etc. So, you would THINK hard drives would be sold as 256, 512, 1024. But they aren't. Why?\n\nSo why 240, 250, etc instead of 256? The answer is a cross between functionality and marketing. Let's say I have 256GB. \n\n1) **HDDs and 250**: This is still a piece of paper with 256 lines / a drive with 256 GB. But, the marketing is done either by or for people who aren't particularly tech-savvy: 250 is a nice round number and 256 is not. \"250 lines on this piece of paper!\" vs \"256 lines on this piece of paper!\". 250 sounds nicer. So 256 has become 250, 512 has become 500, etc (see [this](http://petapixel.com/2012/10/10/why-hard-drives-and-memory-cards-have-less-space-than-advertised/)).\n\n2) **SSDs and 240**: There's still 256 lines of paper here - 256GB of room. But here, the SSD itself saves some of the room for itself. So maybe out of those 256 lines, there are actually only 240 lines on the paper that you're allowed to use here; the other 16 are extra lines (in case you're writing something and it goes over the last line - it has to go somewhere, so we write the overflow on line 241), or backup lines (oops, let's say you just tore the paper or spilled ink on line 194, let's copy everything on line 194 over to line 242), or just lines to make an index - so maybe lines 243-247 are taken up to say, \"She has the grocery list on line 210\". And then the remaining 247-256 are more overflow/backup/index lines. So while there technically ARE 256 GB, you as a user can only use 240 of them. So, it's sold as 240. (And again, it's probably more like 243.24 but 240 is a \"prettier\" number).\n\nAlso, I think u/troycheek has the best ELImaybe20 so far.

      "547": "The heart of your question is really 'How are social networks formed?\" The textbook answer is that you need a **critical mass** of users, so that when someone new signs up, there are other people to interact with. Otherwise no matter how many people download your app, the newcomers will just leave if people are just trickling in, which means the app will be perpetually unpopular. The key then is to get a large number of users *at once*, so that the network becomes sustainable.\n\nHowever, this answer only leads to more questions because it creates a paradox that many people refer to as \"the chicken and the egg problem.\" How can you convince the first users to sign up when no one else is around? Unfortunately, there's no easy answer, which is why businesses are willing to pay an incredible amount of money just to buy an existing social network. If you've ever wondered why Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter are worth so much even though they have no clear business model, this is exactly why (social networks are valuable because they are very difficult to create).\n\nNevertheless, here are a few guidelines that can help create a network. They don't always work (e.g. Google+ have tried and failed), but these are characteristics that successful social networks share:\n\n1) Start with a small but concentrated population. For example, Facebook was initially only available to Harvard students. Once it reached a critical mass of users there, it then expanded to other ivies, and then to all colleges, and finally to everyone. The same can be seen for dating apps like Coffee Meets Bagel, which first started off in NYC, and then gradually expanded to other cities before opening up to everyone. \n\nWhen you start off with a localized population, you lower your marketing costs and you get more mileage out of word of mouth. It's much easier to simultaneously sign up 1000 users in one city than it is to simultaneously sign up 1000 users in a thousand cities.\n\n\n2) Rely on users to recruit other users. Social apps become more useful when more people sign up, which means the users themselves are interested in helping advertise the app. For example, Venmo isn't very useful if your friends don't use it, so there's already an incentive for you to get your friends to install it. This growth will happen slowly over time, but because a critical mass requires a lot of simultaneous new users, you can speed up the process by rewarding existing users who help you expand your network. Venmo did this with a $20 referral bonus to both the new user and the friend who referred them. Other apps reward in-app currencies or features, such as letting you message more people on dating apps.\n\n3) Minimize sign up costs for users. If you've ever wondered why many computer games (e.g. League of Legends) and mobile games are free to play, it's because the very presence of a user is valuable. A multiplayer game would be unplayable if no one else is there. Thus, companies will literally pay new users (e.g. Venmo example above) to sign up. Of course, this is very costly, so the next best thing is to offer the app for free. ",

      "549": "The most exciting thing in a baseball game to me is not necessarily the outcome, but the process of watching a pitcher duel with a hitter.\n\nThere's so much more going on at the plate that a casual fan may not be aware of. All of the three main players in an at bat - the pitcher, catcher, and batter - have all studied each other. This leads to an intricate mind game that enhances the pure physical battle of trying to make bat meet ball. \n\nThe pitcher and catcher know the batter's tendencies in (1) what pitch counts he likes to swing, (2) where he favors the ball, (3) what types of pitches he tends to hit, and (4) his timing/swing/posture at the plate.\n\nLikewise, the batter has studied them in the same ways, knowing (1) what pitches the pitcher has at his command, (2) when he likes to throw certain types of pitches, (3) where he likes to locate those pitches, and (4) his rhythm/motion/pace of pitching.\n\nAnd - to add to the complexity - the guys know the other has studied them. So each has to be self-aware of their vulnerabilities and how they match up with the player they're facing. If the pitcher is a guy who likes to be a flame thrower and wants to get outs based on his fastball speed and location, but the hitter is superb at hitting fastballs, he needs to adjust. Conversely, if the hitter isn't a guy who is likely to catch up to a good heater, he needs to know when and where this pitcher might throw a secondary pitch, a change up or type of breaking ball, to have a chance to hit it.\n\nThe batter's base line strategy is to not make an out. Depending on the game situation that can be modified in any number of ways, but the battle between pitcher and batter always remains. The pitcher is trying to maximize his strengths and pitch against the batter's vulnerabilities, while the batter is trying to capitalize on his knowledge of the pitcher to wait for a pitch he believes he can be successful at hitting safely. \n\nThis leads to many batters going to the plate looking for \"their pitch.\" Like in the previous example, a batter who isn't adept at hitting A+ fastballs against a power pitcher will go to the plate knowing that in certain pitch counts - let's say with one strike - the pitcher likes to throw a low breaking ball. The batter will key in on that particular pitch and hope that its in a good spot for him as he'll be ready to pounce on it. The batter also knows he's weak at fastballs above the belt so he needs to either be ready to take his best swing at one during the at bat or be OK with letting it go and waiting for a different pitch. Of course with two strikes he's got to be mentally ready for it either way and needs to adjust physically - choking up on the bat, shortening his swinging motion - to have a chance. \n\nThe battles between pitcher and hitter are different every time, and a lot of starting pitchers will save one of their pitches for the second or third time they are going through a line-up in a game so that they can keep the batters off-balance and not let them feel comfortable at the plate. The batters, knowing their own tendencies, will at times change their approach at the plate - ie, a guy who never swings at the first pitch will pounce on the first throw hoping to surprise the pitcher who might be throwing a \"get over\" pitch early in the count. So, history between two players is as important to them and relevant as the current at-bat, each trying to build upon what they've learned from previous encounters to gain the advantage. \n\nThere are few things more intense in sports than watching a great hitter and a great pitcher square off in a high pressure moment in a game. There's so much more going on that simply \"I want to get a hit.\"\n\nEdit: obligated to say thanks for the gold! My first. Truly appreciate it. \n\nAnd I walked my dogs and thought more about this and wanted to add - all of this mentality aside - you have to then appreciate the fact these guys have to physically perform. The pitcher can know the perfect pitch to throw but he's got to execute it. The batter can be looking for their preferred pitch but has to make the good swing when they see it. And the batter has to be ready to capitalize on a mistake pitch in fractions of a second. If he's mentally prepared for a fastball inside but the pitcher hangs a curve on the outer third of the plate the batter needs to react and pound that meatball. \n\nThere's preparation - and that's so important and can go a long way towards success - and then there's execution. God I love baseball. \n\n2nd Edit: A few people have asked for video examples. I found a video from MLB Network where former players Mark DeRosa and Carlos Pena talk about how they would approach facing Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta - who when this video was made had recently thrown two no-hitters and was the reigning National League Cy Young winner (aka the previous year's best pitcher). They preach going up against a guy like Arrieta as a hitter you have to have a game plan on what pitch you're looking for and where in the zone because if you don't - you're already out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZKZvVYfANw\n\nAnd another MLB Network video where Bill Ripken breaks down the different effect a simple fastball & change-up combination can have on a hitter. These are the two most \"basic\" pitches in baseball and pitchers can get people out simply combining them effectively. Now you see what hitters are up against... and this before you throw in curves, sliders, cutters, sinkers, etc, and vast combinations of them. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkUM_iKXDeo  ",

      "553": "I work in a lab that studies addiction as part of a research institute focused on addictions as a whole. I have had many conversations in lab meetings with my professor whom is an expert in addictions. \n\nThere are many avenues of research currently being explored as it relates to addiction. I can point people in the direction of two interesting avenues of research. First, is Neuropeptide-Y. It is a peptide, meaning protein based, neuromodulator active in the brain. You have no doubt heard of dopamine and serotonin. Well, to put it simply, neuropeptide-y operates at a level above these neurotransmitters as a neuromodulator having widespread prolonged effects. Some research has implicated it in relation to PTSD. You can google a paper written by Nulk, Schuh, and Burrell produced by the United States Military Academy. There is research currently being done at the institute at which I work regarding NPY and addiction. In summary, acute administration of NPY via injection directly into the brain of rats reduces behavioral indicators of cocaine addiction. The grant info can be found here: http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-DA021261-01A1\n\nIn addition, I am seeing a lot of things here that run contrary to things I understand about addiction. \n\nFor example, I am seeing the self-medication explanation frequently here. The reality is that a self-medication theory would be supported by research that shows when the underlying issue that an individual is 'self-medicating' goes away, the addiction goes away. This is generally not the case from what I recall. Within that subgroup, there are individuals who are heavy users that get addicted and remain addicted after an issue has been treated and there are those who never get addicted and shuck the drug once the issue has been treated. \n\nAn interesting note is that research has not isolated a single valid marker for addiction. That means they cannot take an individual and test them for this marker to determine if they are addicted. The same can be said for a marker for vulnerability to addiction.\n\nI can try to answer some questions if anyone has specific ones. There is so much to be said about addiction. I wasn't sure what to write, but I wanted to get something out there that would be read before it is drowned out by other responses so this is somewhat incomplete. In addition, if there are enough people interested I could get my professor who is an addictions expert in behavioral neuroscience to weigh in and perhaps even do an ama. Would need a lot of interest in that before I even asked though haha. Again, any questions just ask me.\n",

Tools exist that then link those tables and read the information in them fairly effeciently.  Oracle, MySQL, etc handle massive amounts of data pretty easily.  Because these tools don't actually care what the data is, they just need the reference points, they can quickly retrieve the data.  \n  \nThink of how RAM works: fast switching pointers.  This is how you get a user's data out of billions in a table.  The software doesn't need to know that the person's first name is JOHN, it just needs to know that that user's pointer is here and it points to that table and then that table points to the next connected bit of data, etc.  It is a chain of tables.  Again, most of the retreival of the data isn't getting ALL of the data, it is just getting the pointer.  That pointer leads to the next pointer, and so forth.  Just fast swapping pointers and then one DISPLAY of the data.  \n  \nBig Data as it is termed, is a huge industry specifically for this challenge.

      "560": "Software engineer here. There's a lot of wrong information in here guys... I cannot delve into all of it. But these are the big ones: (also, this is going to be more like an ELI15)\n\nA lot of you are saying CPU render favors quality and GPU does quick but dirty output. This is wrong. Both a CPU and GPU are chips able to execute calculations at insane speeds. They are unaware of what they are calculating. They just calculate what the software asks them to.\n\n**Quality is determined by the software.** A 3D image is built up by a 3D mesh, shaders and light. The mesh (shape) of which the quality is mostly expressed in amount of polygons, where high poly count adds lots of shape detail but makes the shape a lot more complex to handle. A low poly rock shape can be anywhere from 500 to 2000 poly, meaning amount of little facets. A high poly rock can be as stupid as 2 to 20 million polygons.\n\nYou may know this mesh as wireframe.\n\nGames will use the lowest amount of polygons per object mesh as possible to still make it look good. Offline renderer projects will favor high poly for the detail, adding time to calculate as a cost. \n\nThat 3D mesh is just a \"clay\" shape though. It needs to be colored and textures. Meet shaders. A shader is a set of instructions on how to display a 'surface'. The simplest shader is a color. Add to that, a behavior with light reflectance. Glossy? Matte? Transparant? Add those settings to calculate. We can fake a lot of things in a shader. A lot of things that seems geometry even. \n\nWe tell the shader to fake bumpiness and height in a surface (eg a brick wall) by giving it a bump map which it used to add fake depth in a surface. That way the mesh needs to be way less detailed. I can make a 4 point square look like a detailed wall with grit, shadows and height texture all with a good shader. \n\nExample: http://www.xperialize.com/nidal/Polycount/Substance/Brickwall.jpg\nThis is purely a shader with all texture maps. Plug these maps in a shader in the right channels and your 4-point plane can look like a detailed mesh all by virtue of shader faking the geometry.\n\nSome shaders can even mimic light passing through like skin or candle wax. Subsurface scattering. Some shaders emit light like fire should. \n\nThe more complex the shader, the more time to calculate. In a renderend frame, every mesh needs it's own shader(s) or materials (configured shaders, reusable for a consistent look). \n\nLet's just say games have a 60 fps target. Meaning 60 rendered images per second go to your screen. That means that every 60th of a second an image must be ready.\n\nFor a game, we really need to watch our polygon count per frame and have a polygon budget. Never use high poly meshes and don't go crazy with shaders.\n\nThe CPU calculates physics, networking, mesh points moving, shader data etc per frame. Why the CPU? Simple explanation is because we have been programming CPUs for a long time and we are good at it. The CPU has more on its plate but we know how to talk to it and our shaders are written in it's language.\n\nA GPU is just as dumb as a CPU but it is more available if that makes sense. It is also built to do major grunt work as an image rasterizer. In games, we let the GPU do just that. Process the bulk data after the CPU and raster it to pixels. It's more difficult to talk to though, so we tend not to instruct it directly. But more and more, we are giving it traditionally CPU roles to offload, because we can talk to it better and better due to genius people.\n\nGames use a technique called Direct Lighting. Where light is mostly faked and calculated as a flash. As a whole. Shadows and reflections can be baked into maps. It's a fast way for a game but looks less real. \n\nEnter the third (mesh, shader, now light) aspect of rendering time. Games have to fake it. Because this is what takes the highest render time. The most accurate way we can simulate light rays onto shaded meshes is Ray tracing. This is a calculation of a light Ray travelling across the scene and hitting everything it can, just like real light.\n\nRay tracing is very intensive but it is vastly superior to DL. Offline rendering for realism is done with RT. In DirectX12, Microsoft has given games a way to use a basic form of Ray tracing. But it slams our current cpus and gpus because even this basic version is so heavy.\n\nThings like Nvidia RTX use hardware dedicated to process Ray tracing, but it's baby steps. Without RTX cores though, RT is too heavy to do real time. But technically, RTX was made to process the DirectX raytracing and it is not required. It's just too heavy to enable for the older GPU's and it won't make sense.\n\nAnd even offline renderers are benefiting from the RTX cores. Octane Renderer 2020 can render scenes up to 7X faster due to usage of the RTX cores. So that's really cool.\n\n--- edit\n\nJust to compare; here is a mesh model with Octane shader materials and offline raytracing rendering I did recently: https://i.redd.it/d1dulaucg4g41.png (took just under an hour to render on my RTX 2080S)\n\nAnd here is the same mesh model with game engine shaders in realtime non-RT rendering: https://imgur.com/a/zhrWPdu (took 1/140th of a second to render)\n\nDifferent techniques using the hardware differently for, well, a different purpose ;)",

      "562": "There is not one right answer - This phenomenon can be caused by various reason among which include genetic mutation as well. \n  \nThat little pepper inside a bigger pepper is called an “internal proliferation.” Its form can vary from irregular and contorted to a near-perfect but sterile fruit.\n  \nA pepper growing inside a pepper is a type of parthenocarpy, which is the formation of fruits without fertilization or the formation of seeds. No one is sure what causes them, but temperature and nutrient levels have been ruled out.\n\nPlant breeders, who consider this anomaly undesirable, keep an eye out for it when selecting for new cultivars, because the trait is inheritable.\n  \n*More Details*\n  \nDuring the normal development of bell peppers, seeds develop from fertilized structures or ovules. There are a multitude of ovules within the pepper which turn into tiny seeds that we discard before eating the fruit. When a pepper ovule gets a wild hair, it develops an internal proliferation, or carpelloid formation, which more resembles the parent pepper rather than a seed. \n  \nNormally, fruit forms if ovules have been fertilized and are developing into seeds. On occasion, a process called parthenocarpy occurs wherein the fruit forms with an absence of seeds. \n   \nThere is some evidence that suggests there is a correlation between the parasitic pepper inside a pepper. Internal proliferations most often develop in the absence of fertilization when the carpelloid structure mimics the role of seeds resulting in parthenocarpic pepper growth. \n  \nParthenocarpy is already responsible for seedless oranges and the lack of large, unpleasant seeds in bananas. Understanding its role in engendering parasitic peppers may end up creating seedless pepper varieties.\n  \n Whatever the exact cause, commercial growers consider this an undesirable trait and tend to select newer cultivars for cultivation. The pepper baby, or parasitic twin, is perfectly edible, however, so it’s almost like getting more bang for your buck. I suggest just eating the little pepper inside a pepper and continue to marvel at the strange mysteries of nature.\n  \n_____________________________________________________\n  \n[Source 1](http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Gardening/diggin-it/2010/0401/Have-you-ever-found-a-pepper-inside-a-pepper)\n  \n[Source 2](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/pepper/little-pepper-inside-pepper.htm)",

      "575": "I don't think most of the answers here are addressing your question. Time dilation allows clocks to tick slow but not to reverse, which I assume is what you are asking about.\n\n**The short answer:**\n\nInside a rotating black hole, our current theories of gravitation tell us that there is a region where not only does time go in a circle, it actually *has* to. This is only inside of the black hole, which is impossible to escape, so while it's technically time travel, it's confined to the inside of the black hole.\n\n**The longer answer:**\n\nThe most intuitive way to think about general relativity is to say that gravity is basically \"falling space.\" Space-time curvature is true as well, but harder to visualize meaningfully. Essentially, the reason you are pulled toward the earth is because space is falling. An object falling toward the earth is not actually accelerating, it's just being dragged along by space as it falls toward the earth.\n\nIn a black hole, there is a region that is falling so fast that not even light can escape. This is called the event horizon. You would have to travel faster than the speed of light to escape. In relatively, traveling faster than the speed of light from one point of view is equivalent to traveling backward in time from another point of view.\n\nIn a rotating black hole, there is a second horizon called the cauchy horizon. Here space itself is swirling around the center of the black hole so rapidly that it's actually impossible not to travel around it. \"Standing still\" would require traveling backward in time.\n\nAnd yet, because space is swirling in a circle around the black hole, you actually find yourself revisiting the same point over and over again. Since in relativity revisiting this point would require going backward in time, what's actually happening is that you're traveling through a circle in time. Each time you revisit the same point around the black hole, you are revisiting the same moment.\n\nIt's important to recognize that most physicists think time travel and closed timelike curves like this are actually impossible, and that a complete theory of quantum gravity will rule them out for good.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold!",

Here goes anyway:\n\nAs a former restaurant dishwasher for about 2.5 years, these machines would be *hugely* inefficient for home use. The home dishwasher is made to be more water and energy efficient, as /u/IllyriaGodKing said, while the industrial sized machines are made to be efficient over many, *many* uses.\n\nFirstly, in the case of the one restaurant I worked for, the machine wasn't owned by the restaurant, but leased from the company that made it. This gave us access to their repairmen when things inevitably and frequently went wrong. Paddles sticking in the on position, paddles sticking in the off position, not drawing on any soap, using too much soap, drain clogs, power failures, heat failures, nearly everything that you could imagine to go wrong did at one point. You need access to these professionals or all of their tools and knowledge.\n\nSecond, these aren't made for you to cook throughout the day, load up all your dishes at once, and be done in three minutes. I want one myself for that reason, because that kitchen spoiled me as far as quick and easy cleanliness. What they're made to do is fill up a large, multiple gallon tank of water in the morning, keep it heated all day, wash many large loads through the day, and empty and clean out at night. This is how they become efficient and affordable for a restaurant; they actually have a quantity of dishes to call for it as a need. At home, we'll waste gallons of water and lots of energy.\n\nFinally, all the maintenance that isn't covered by the aforementioned professionals: regular ass cleaning of this giant ass machine. You'll need to do it *a lot*. Solid food waste will get stuck in the drains, the water jets, the gratings below the wash area. The presence of large quantities of water on rust resistant metal will cause lime to build up in great amounts.

Remember that what is inside that \"sphere\" is *everything*. It's the whole universe. It's impossible to look at it from the outside because there is no concept of \"outside the universe\". The idea of what it looks like from the outside is meaningless.\n\nWhy do all those animations show a sphere then? Well, in part because of the [Cosmological Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle), which says \nthat the universe looks the same no matter the direction we look, and the natural way to depict that is with a sphere (and because [sphere shapes are very common in space](https://www.universetoday.com/112805/why-is-everything-spherical/)), but that's not the way that real explosions work. Even the most perfectly packed explosions don't generate perfectly spherical shockwaves.\n\nImportantly, there would be no way for us to tell if the universe is shaped like, say, a giant chicken, because spacetime has no edges.

      "605": "Well simply put - **Because our brains are bad at multitasking** \n  \nDaydreaming is a short-term detachment from one's immediate surroundings, during which a person's contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by a visionary fantasy, especially one of happy, pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and experienced while awake.\n  \nDay dreaming is not actual sleep (despite the word \"dream\"). It is simply a short-term detachment from your surrounding. Put simply, it it just your mind wondering. Like any other action you take, you do it with your eyes opened.\n  \nThis is mainly due to our brains being very good at selective attention. It is impossible for the human brain to focus on every bit of information it receives, so instead it will focus on one or two main points and effectively ignore the rest.\n  \nWhen we form mental images, we use many of the same parts of the brain as we use to process visual images. So, when you bring up a vivid mental image, you aren't able to make full use of those areas to process what you're actually seeing. Obviously, there is still plenty of information coming in through your eyes, but since you are distracted, it is not processed as thoroughly as when you are focused on the world around you.\n  \nThe same goes for when you bring a memory to mind. I've often been listening to someone talk, and when something they says triggers a memory, I might not even hear what they said for the next few moments. The brain isn't too great at multitasking.\n  \nThere are many types of daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst psychologists, however the characteristic that is common to all forms of daydreaming meets the criteria for mild dissociation.\n  \n*What part of the brain switches those controls saying to stop processing outside information and start imagining?*\n  \nWe are not sure. It gets tricky from here. Not sure if is understandable for a five year old :( Experts now agree, however, that daydreaming is a normal, and even beneficial, cognitive function-albeit one that is largely still not understood. An area of the brain called the “default network,” which becomes more active as the level of external stimulus decreases, is often considered responsible for daydreaming. The default network mainly includes the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), the posterior cingulated cortex/precuneus region, and the temporoparietal junction \n\nNeuroimaging studies have offered support for this hypothesis, though only indirectly. These studies demonstrated “correlations between reported frequency of task-unrelated thoughts and default network activation during conditions of low cognitive demand, as well as stronger default network activation during highly practiced compared with novel tasks in people with higher propensity for mind wandering.” A different interpretation of these data, offered by Gilbert et al., argued that “instead of mind wandering, activations in the medial PFC part of the default network may reflect stimulus-related thought such as enhanced watchfulness toward the external environment that is also likely to occur during highly practiced tasks”\n  \nMore info here - http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/fall-2010/science-of-daydreaming#.UuFtfGTTnLY",

That's a basic signal transmission from one neuron to the next in (certain parts of) the brain and low serotonin levels here is closely linked with depression. The amount of serotonin released depends on the signal moving along the neuron as well as the neuron's autoregulation which is based on the amount of serotonin already in the synapse. \n\nHere's a basic diagram of a synapse http://institute.progress.im/sites/default/files/styles/content_full/public/depression_-_moa_of_ssris.jpg?itok=bt7Fr77R \n\nWhen you start an SSRI, you inhibit the reuptake of serotonin from the synapse, which means the serotonin level in the synapse remains high after a signal. This is good, and this is the aim of SSRIs. However, high serotonin levels mean that the autoreceptors on the pre-synaptic neuron tell the neuron that serotonin levels are good and you don't need to release any more. This is bad, and drives serotonin release down. \n\nEventually after ~2 weeks, the increased base level of serotonin in the synapse after a signal as a result of the reuptake inhibition causes the auto-regulators to involute (be absorbed back into the neuron/stop being expressed on the surface) because they are being activated too often. This means the auto-inhibition falls, and serotonin levels rise properly and reach a \"normal\" level of functioning again\n\nThe 2 week lag period where auto-inhibition is high, before the auto-regulators can involute causes reduced serotonin levels and in some people can worsen symptoms of depression. This should be and is often not explained when people are started on SSRI anti-depressants \n\nHopefully this reply won't be buried/missed by OP I know I got here pretty late sorry my bad\n\nSource: final year medical student\n\nEdit: as u/earf pointed out below, the auto-regulatory receptors (5-HT1A) are in the somatodendritic (start of the neuron) area of the pre-synaptic neuron. SSRIs increase the level of serotonin in this area (at the receptor area of the neuron). The increased level of serotonin in this area slowly (as the receptors turn over and get renewed) cause a decrease in the number of 5-HT1A receptors. These receptors normally inhibit the amount of serotonin released (from the end of the neuron), so as they are reduced, the amount of serotonin release at the other end of the neuron goes up. This slow decrease in the number of inhibitory auto-regulatory receptors (at the start of the neuron) is what causes the lag effect ",

Your average Ashkenazi Jewish person isn't going to look exactly like your average Sephardic Jewish person isn't going to look your average Bukharan Jewish person isn't going to look like your average Cochin Jewish person, because during the several Jewish diaspora, the Jewish peoples moved into other nations, fell in love with and had children with local ethnic groups, but also had a significant degree of intermarriage and unique customs that each of these groups became distinct ethnically.\n\nWith regard to Catholicism/early Christianity/orthodox faiths, remember that during its spread, the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, etc., spread them by force and conquest, and sent missionaries out to every land under the sun. \"Catholic,\" as an adjective, literally means \"universal.\" The idea was that everyone was obligated to convert to Christianity. Some iterations of the faith took this to mean \"... or die!\" while others did not. So the reason why there is no strong ethnic association with Catholicism (there are weak associations; the Irish, Italians, Latin Americans, etc.) is because Catholicism never envisioned itself as the faith of any particular ethnic group. It was always practiced by multi-ethnic groups of early Christians. \n\nJudaism, on the other hand, was the ethnic religion of the Hebrews, much like all of the Indo-European groups had some version of the PIE religion. Catholicism, for the most part, wiped out folk religions of Indo-Europeans, to the point today where all attempts at reconstructing those folk religions for worship are at best copies of copies of what we think someone eight hundred years dead thought about those religions. But there are always movements within ethnic groups to practice that group's traditional religion.

      "622": "I don't like how these responses are phrased, so let me take a stab at it:\n\nMuch in the same way that crawling, is different than walking, is different than jogging, is different than running, there are actually different types of sleep.  We call these sleep stages 1, 2, 3, and REM.  And, just like you can't go instantly from crawling to a full sprint, you must go through each sleep stage in order. \n\nNow, REM sleep is very important and your body really needs to get there to have a successful sleep cycle, so As long as you don't wake up before your body can finish REM sleep, your doing well.  And if you are wondering, this usually takes between 90-110 minutes.  So if our sleep cycle is so short, why don't we wake up after 110 minutes?  Well, that's because one cycle usually isn't enough for our body to get everything done, so once it finishes one cycle, it starts over.  \n\nNow, because this is part of being human, it is different for all people, all ages, and dependent on how tired you are, how sleep deprived you are, drugs, hormones, etc. But, as a general rule, adults spend about 20 minutes in REM sleep per cycle, and you aren't sleeping enough until you get about 1.5-2 hours of REM a night.  And if you do the math, that leads to the recommendation of about 8 hours of sleep a night.\n\n----------------\n\nSo, to answer your question:\n\nSince you must first go through stages 1, 2, and 3 before you get to REM, unless you break up your sleep exactly between cycles, you probably won't get enough REM sleep.  But assuming you monitored your brain and had an alarm triggered excatly between stages, it still probably wouldn't be enough.  Why?\n\nBecause sleep is more complicated than that.  \n\nThe longer you sleep, the longer you spend in deep sleep and REM sleep.  So, your first sleep cycle of the night will actually spend longer in stage 1 and 2, and less in stage 3 and REM than your fourth cycle of the night.  So, if you wake up in the middle of your sleep, you probably aren't getting an average of 20 minutes REM per cycle.  \n\nBut that's not always the case.\n\nIf your body really needs REM sleep, you will spend less time in stages 1 and two and more in deep sleep and REM.  Though, as far as I know, this is not really healthy since all stages are important to mental health.  If you have ever had one of those mentally exhausting days where you immediately go to sleep, and are pretty much able to sleep through WW3, that's probably when your body has decided to hurry up to deep sleep (stage 3) and REM.  \n\nBut that's still not a full answer.\n\nSo 3 is pushing it, but is a 2 cycle sleep (biphasic sleep) good enough then?  Probably.  Funny enough, sleep is evolved to work with our environment, and our environment has changed much faster than we have evolved.  Namely, we now live in comfortable safe boxes where there is no worry that jaguars are going to eat us at night.  It is thought that our defense to this was to have short deep sleep cycles, so noises can wake us up, and to fully wake up for a while in the middle of the night.  Waking up in the night allowed humans to do whatever was necessary (sex, fire, scouting, night hunting, etc).  And really, this was the norm up for people until the 1900s.  People have written about using this time for sex and writing, because it was cooler outside, and because other people were asleep. [wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep#Historical_norm)\n\nTL;DR - 2 sleeps is probably fine, and there is active research to see if that may be better for our bodies.

In human biology the testicles sit outside of the body so that sperm can be produced because at a internal temperature of 98.6 degrees they cannot produce sperm. However sitting outside the body exposure to colder air can also decrease the Bloods temperature enough that when entering back into the body it could cause a person to go into shock. So in the human testicle there exists a cross current system where the artery coming out of the body into the testicles passes by the vein that returns back in thus cooling the internal hot arterial blood when it comes out, and warming back up the cold venous blood when it goes back into the body.\n\nThe same exact cross-current system exists in a penguin's foot so that the arterial blpod can be cooled down to a temperature that the feet can not melt through the ice and then warmed back up on its way in so it doesn't cause Penguins to go into shock.\n\nAnd that my friends is why a penguin's foot is like a testicle.

      "632": "*Edited to add:* Well this was popular! Cool! I'll take this opportunity to recommend Wikipedia for a *first pass* at understanding health issues. I double-checked this post with the Wikipedia articles [lactose intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance), [milk allergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk allergy), [lactase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase), and [lactose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose).\n\n----\n\nThere's a difference between *dairy allergy* and *lactose intolerance*. Often the one that causes fast diarrhea is lactose intolerance, not dairy allergy. Dairy allergy can be much, much worse.\n\n----\n\nDairy allergy is a person's immune system responding to milk proteins as if they're a harmful germ. It works the same as any other serious food allergy.\n\nLactose intolerance is when a person doesn't produce lact**a**se, a protein that breaks down milk sugar (lact**o**se). This is actually normal for most adult mammals; most mammals don't drink milk after infancy. But adult humans from some parts of the world *do* produce lactase, and so we have cuisines that use a lot of milk and milk products in places like Europe and India. People whose ancestors came from Europe, India, or some parts of Africa are much more likely to be able to drink milk without a problem; people whose ancestors came from East Asia are more likely to have a problem.\n\n(Because lactose intolerance is actually normal, some people refer to the opposite as *lactase persistence* instead. They're saying that we need a word to describe the unusual condition (adults drinking milk), not the usual one (only babies drink milk). However, if you're living in far northern Europe where almost everyone has lactase persistence, and you don't, you're the one who will have trouble with the local food.)\n\n----\n\nDairy allergy can cause anaphylactic shock, which can kill; it can also cause rashes, hives, shortness of breath, and other allergy symptoms, *and* bowel trouble too. It can take anywhere from minutes, to hours, to a week after eating/drinking dairy products before the allergy symptoms actually kick in.\n\nLactose intolerance is the one that usually makes people have diarrhea, gas, burps, nausea, etc. shortly after drinking milk (within 30 minutes). What's happening is that the undigested lactose feeds bacteria in the intestines, which produce gas.\n\n----\n\nSome people with milk allergies are okay eating baked goods or other cooked foods that are made with milk. This is because cooking causes the proteins to denature, or bend/break at the molecular level. Don't ever assume this if you know someone has a milk allergy, though; ask them if they can eat those things. As I said above, milk allergy can kill.\n\nThere's also a way to work around lactose intolerance: add lactase to milk. This is what the \"Lactaid\" brand of milk does. Fermented milk products such as yogurt or kefir are made with microbes that eat the lactose and turn it into acids; this is why yogurt is sour compared to milk.",

      "634": "The broken window fallacy (in reality) is that money spent to repair destruction doesn't represent a net benefit to society (in other words the fallacy would state that destruction provides a net benefit to society)... I will end this with a story pulled from investopedia that explores the idea. The main basis of it comes from the idea that if something is destroyed then money will be spent to replace it... That money spent will then go into circulation and stimulate the economy... However this makes an implication that destroying things will benefit the economy. \n\n\n\n>In Bastiat's tale, a man's son breaks a pane of glass, meaning the man will have to pay to replace it. The onlookers consider the situation and decide that the boy has actually done the community a service because his father will have to pay the glazier (window repair man) to replace the broken pane. The glazier will then presumably spend the extra money on something else, jump-starting the local economy.\n\nThis seems all well and good... But using the implications from that alone it would become justifiable to say that people should go around breaking everyones windows in order to stimulate the economy as then the local glaziers would get paid more and as such they would spend more... However if we continue:\n\n>The onlookers come to believe that breaking windows stimulates the economy, but Bastiat points out that further analysis exposes the fallacy. By breaking the window, the man's son has reduced his father's disposable income, meaning his father will not be able purchase new shoes or some other luxury good. Thus, the broken window might help the glazier, but at the same time, it robs other industries and reduces the amount being spent on other goods. Moreover, replacing something that has already been purchased is a maintenance cost, rather than a purchase of truly new goods, and maintenance doesn't stimulate production. In short, Bastiat suggests that destruction - and its costs - don't pay in an economic sense.\n\nFrom: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/broken-window-fallacy.asp\n\n\nEdit: for those of you saying to break the windows of the rich or the 1%, no that is not the moral. The anecdote isn't perfect but one of the big conclusions you can get from it is that if the broken window theory were true then it would be beneficial to constantly destroy things to stimulate the economy.... Therefore we should constantly blow up bridges because then a construction company is paid to repair it... But if you don't destroy the bridge you can save the money or spend it on other things, spread the money around... If you save money in a bank then that bank can give out larger loans to people and create more progress, if you have more money (because you aren't constantly paying to repair things) then you might save up and eventually buy things like a house which does more to spread the money around than buying a new window...\n\nThe logic behind this isn't perfect either... So I am going to steal (paraphrase) this from one of the replies that is on here (and I will credit the person afterwards): if you are 18 and you have saved up $5000 to go to college, enough for a couple semesters then you can spend that money, get an education (say in engineering) and get (hypothetically) a decent job that will work to stimulate the economy more... However if I come alogng and destroy your car with a baseball bat (break the windows, bust the tail lights) and you now have to pay $2500 to get it repaired then yes in the short term the mechanic that repaired your car did get more money but you are unable to pay for as much of your education which can put you in a detriment and to some extent the local economy in the long run. Beyond that, if everyone starts destroying cars then the mechanic will get rich and will get a lot of money (an uneccesary amount of money) and it might end up leaving circulation thus acting as a detriment to the local economy.\n\nParaphrased frome: u/grizwald87",

The way the components work together may be very tightly coupled, and the code the games run may be so optimized that e.g. the time it takes for some routine on the graphics chip to complete might be highly interdependent on the CPU getting some other task done fast enough to even run a game stable.\n\nThe new gen might be called e.g. the PS4, but inside the hardware is nothing like the PS3 at all. To make the older code run on the new hardware, the newer device has to intercept everything the old code thinks it's doing on the old hardware and make it work on the new hardware instead, with no discrepancies in behavior. This is called emulation. That's usually very hard to do and the emulator code itself takes time to process too.\n\nThe result is that unless the new hardware actually contains a lot of same the chips that the older hardware also had, or the manufacturer abstracted away the functionality behind an easily re-implememted API (like DirectX), you need a much, much faster processor to have any chance of emulating the old system fast enough to make it perform well.\n\nEspecially in older generation devices, before the likes of XBox with it's more standardized directx-like API, coders used to write code that talked to hardware directly. It means emulators have to interrupt almost everything that code does and pretend to do the same thing on the newer hardware.\n\nImagine writing an emulator: Your program has to read hundreds of thousands of instructions per second, transform them into instructions that can be understood by the new hardware, translate instructions for the video and audio and I/O chips, keep all their work in sync like on the original system even though the performance of the new hardware is totally different, and do it all fast enough to keep everything running in real-time as far as the user can tell.\n\nEven today there are still devices from 25 years ago (like Amiga) that still don't have perfect emulation and where code still runs better on a 7Mhz original device than a 2Ghz PC running an emulator.\n\nThe performance cost of emulation can be so great that some consoles that can run games from older generation systems go as far as including most of the older generation hardware to be able to do it. For example, older PS3's have chips in them that are compatible with ones from the PS2 and can play PS2 games. Newer model PS3's don't, and can't.\n\ntl;dr: Your PS3 makes beef burgers.

      "647": "I'm actually reading a book right now that talks about this: \"Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World\" by Nick Lane\n\nYes, fire did burn differently because of excess oxygen fuel.  During the carboniferous period, 300-350 million years ago,  oxygen levels reached as high as 35%, compared to today's ~20%.  This allowed fires to start in places which we wouldn't normally expect (places of high humidity, during rain storms).  Today we find fossilized charcoal in coal beds that arose from peat bogs, which grants credence to the idea that fires did burn much more easily during this period.  You might ask \"how did plants survive the constant danger of fire?\" Adaptation thanks to random evolution.  For example, plants from this period expressed deeper roots/tubers than their modern day counterparts, and the leaves of trees were higher which could help avoid catching fire from a stray brush fire.  \n\nThe reason so much coal (a large part of which is oftentimes fossilized charcoal) remains from this period is due to two factors, as other posters have mentioned.  First The structural material of plants, lignin, doesn't burn rapidly, (paper is often stripped free of lignin which is why it burns so easily) rather it tends to smolder (i.e. logs in a fire), so fires would leave large amounts of charcoal rather than their usual main byproducts: carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide (at lower burning efficiencies) and water.  Secondly, lignin is very hard to digest, even fungus/bacteria today have a hard time digesting it.  300 million years ago, the decay rate was practically zero.  In summary, pretty much all of todays coal comes from plants which, millions of years ago, died and were buried without ever going through the process of decay.\n\nWhat's even cooler though is that during this time gigantic insects roamed the earth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meganeura which is believed to be related to the faster metabolic rates that high oxygen content allows.\n\nAnyways, its a good book if you're interested in the topic.",

This is why they are all have sharp edges to ensure this and show any tampering\nTo create the pips, the material removed to form the pip is refilled with an opaque version of the same material to ensure no change in the weight distribution (which answers the initial question here).\nThe pips must also be drilled and filled rather than painted, to ensure the paint cannot be worn off or altered during play.\nThe dice must be partially translucent, so that you can visually check for things like air bubbles or weights they would influence a roll.\nThe dice are all produced in sets of five, which are all given matching serial numbers - so the dealer knows the set of dice in play and they cannot be substituted.\n\nLots of rules that make sense when gambling for high stakes, but if all I am doing is playing a board game with friends or determining my characters stats in D&D, then the tolerances won't really influence everything enough to make any meaningful difference (though that will never stop posters believing they have 'lucky dice').",

      "657": " I'm a nurse.  I've worked in a nursing home, and currently work in a hospital. I've seen this happen many times, so I'll give it a shot.  \n\nYour body is a bunch of interconnected systems.  They depend upon each other so they can function, not unlike  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd05K6uKyQw).  As you get older, your systems accumulate damage or wear and do not repair themselves as well as they used to.  When enough damage is accumulated, either through extreme age or through abuse of the particular system (often a little bit of both) the system begins to fail.  When it fails, the other systems are stressed in turn.  Since they too have accumulated damage over the years, they don't have much reserves left for dealing with this additional stress, and they begin to fail.  The result is cascade multi organ failure.  Sometimes a person dies of a heart attack or some such thing, and since they were so old we don't look into it, as other posters have said.  I think what you're asking is what it looks like when a body just wears out from extreme age.  I'll give a simplistic example.  \n\nSuppose someone is 99 years old.  Every system in their body has been doing it's job for 99 years, and it is much less powerful and efficient than it used to be.   They have arthritis, so they take ibuprofen for pain management.  They also don't drink enough water, as many elderly don't.  This takes a toll on their kidneys.  Kidneys are responsible for managing waste and water in the body, so if the kidneys start to fail, waste products and fluids begin to back up in the body.  Their heart was functioning adequately for the amount of blood it was supposed to pump, but soon there's significantly more fluid than the heart is prepared for.  The heart begins to work harder, causing the person to get tired easier.  As time goes on, the kidneys continue to go down hill and the fluid backs up even further and begins to collect in the lungs.  The body begins to panic as it realizes the lungs are in danger, so the person starts breathing harder, heart rate increases to try and get oxygen to all the important tissues.  This puts more stress on the heart and lungs, as both systems are being pushed beyond capacity. This increase in blood pressure forces more fluid into the lungs, which results in less oxygen transfer with every breath.  This is a cycle which perpetuates itself, where each effort the body makes to overcome one problem makes another one worse.  Meanwhile, waste products are building up, so nothing works as well as it could, even with age taken into account.  Ultimately, one system or another finally exhausts its reserves and quits. The other systems are so exhausted from trying to prop up the failing system that they almost immediately fail as well. Ultimately, death is caused in the tissues by lack of oxygen.  If the heart fails, the oxygen cant move from the lungs to the tissues.  If the lungs fail, the oxygen can't get from the air into the blood.  In any case, you go long enough without oxygen to a tissue, it dies.  Enough tissue dies, it kills the organ.  Enough organs die, the person dies. So, in the case above you could say the person dies of respiratory arrest, or cardiac arrest, but ultimately it doesn't matter.  Technically I suppose you could call it multisystem organ failure? In any case, the phenomenon is most easily understood as a body just wearing out.  ",

(For reference, that's close to the C two octaves above middle C.) **Harmonics** are multiples of the frequency at lower levels, e.g. 2kHz, 4kHz, 8kHz, and so forth. Adding different harmonics in different mathematical patterns will result in different wave shapes and different sounds. [Wikipedia has some good links on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-sinusoidal_waveform), including sample clips of the main wave forms.\nIncidentally, a given instrument may 'voice' two (or more) notes simultaneously, with a harmonic series for each note, which adds complexity and in some cases (like percussion), perhaps noise.\n\nNow that we have a wave form, we can vary the pitch of it by a little bit. This is **vibrato**, and is described by a width (how much it varies - maybe a quarter tone for example) and frequency (how fast it varies). A similar (but not identical) effect can be got by varying the *volume* by a small amount, which is called **tremolo**.\n\nNow, you can change how fast the note gets up to 'full' volume (**attack**), and how fast it fades away afterwards (**decay**). A flute has a relatively slow attack. A hammered piano note has a much faster attack, and a glockenspiel (with metal bars and hard mallets) is faster still.

Whenever Ebola goes into a cycle where it jumps from infecting the unknown animal to infecting humans, it creates an international scare. The panic is mainly due to its extremely high mortality rate (estimated around 70-90%). Therefore, if 10 people are infected with Ebola, anywhere from 7-9 of them may die. Scary right? This is actually a little misleading, however, because there are several different strains of Ebola - with one of these leading to the high mortality rate and others maybe not even life-threatening. \nAnother reason Ebola is very scary to the public and scientists alike is that we don't really know much about it. As said above, we have no idea what animal the virus resides in it's everyday life. Additionally, it is difficult to research because it is so lethal and has to be contained in very hi-tech locations called BSL4 labs.

Acme sends Bob letters telling him his payment is overdue, please call them so they can work out a deal, etc. etc. \n\n3. Bob avoids them. He doesn't have $100. \n\n4. Eventually, Acme Corporation realizes they will never get that $100, so they *send it to collections*. When a debt is sent to collections, it's basically like Acme Corporation said, \"Well, Bob is never going to pay us back. We're tired of trying. BUT....we might as well get SOMETHING for it.\"\n\n6. So, Acme Corporation sells Bob's debt to a debt collector for $5. \nIt's like if you had a metal box that had $100 in it. You try everything you can to get the box open, but can't do it. So you find someone who is really good at opening metal boxes and say, \"Hey, if you give me $5, then I'll give you this box. If you can get the box open, there's $100 in there for you to keep.\"  \n\n7. Even though the debt collector bought Bob's debt for $5, they can still make Bob pay the full $100. Thus, they make a $95 profit. \n\n8. Now, all the debt collector has to do is use any means they can to make Bob pay. Since this is the only reason the debt collector exists, they can devote a ton of time and energy to making Bob pay -- calling him, sending him letters, etc. etc. If someone owes enough money, the debt collector can sue them in court and garnish their wages. People often end up declaring bankruptcy to escape their debt. \n\n\nIn the meantime, Bob's credit score is destroyed. This means it will be almost impossible to get financing for a house or a new car or apply for a new credit card. Sometimes your credit score even affects whether you get hired for a job. It will take many years of work before Bob's can rebuild his credit score. And in the meantime, he's dealing with the debt collector calling him every day. \n\nNow, imagine that instead of $100, it's actually $50,000 - or $100,000. And you don't owe it to a corporation, you owe it to a hospital because you or one of your family members were in a terrible car accident and had to be flown by helicopter to an urgent care center.

      "686": "I am a PhD student studying aging. This answer may get buried, since this thread is so popular, but hopefully not.\n\nMany people are writing about telomeres. Those who write that their role in aging is overstated are correct. Delete telomerase (the enzyme that lengthens telomeres) in mice, and what happens? Nothing. For five to six generations. That's how long it takes for the telomeres to get short enough to have any effects. Yet mice still age. Humans do have shorter telomeres and longer lives, but our adult stem cells can extend their telomeres whenever they want. So telomeres aren't the answer.\n\nMore people in the field are appreciating the role of epigenetics. Consider that humans have about twenty thousand genes, but only a few thousand are turned on in any given cell. That's what makes a brain cell different than a liver cell, although they have the same exact DNA. Which genes are turned on or off is governed by chemical modifications on DNA and and the proteins that keep it wrapped together. These are known as epigenetic marks. Think of them like bookmarks for which genes to read and which to ignore.\n\nThere is an increasing amount of data that show as we age, our epigenetic marks get screwed up. In the extreme case, this can cause a brain cell to turn on a liver gene, or vice versa. More generally, it means our cells aren't functioning as efficiently as they did when we were young, when the epigenetic state was set correctly.\n\nSo what happens during fertilization and early embryo development? You guessed it -- all the epigenetic marks are wiped clean and totally reset. (Expect for a very few, called imprinting, which is a fascinating area of ongoing research.) As tissues and cells differentiate, \"master regulator\" genes that determine cell identity kick in to set the epigenetics as \"brain cell\" or \"liver cell\".\n\nA surprising study from the Belmonte Lab at the Salk Institute last year showed that by expressing the most fundemental \"master regulators\" (sometimes called Yaminaka factors) at very low levels in mice, you can \"clean up\" the epigenetics without changing cell identity, leading to improved health and possibly increased longevity in aged mice. Super interesting stuff.\n\nThere also is a lot of research aimed at reading your epigenetics to predict your \"biological age\". Steve Horvath at UCLA has shown you can accurately predict a person's age (with an error of  only 3-4 years) based on their epigenetic marks. He has also shown that your \"epigenetic age\" is a decent predictor of how likely you are to die. In my opinion, this is the closest science has gotten to date to developing a Death Clock. Again, super interesting stuff.\n\n",

As the ground gets hotter, the air above the ground also gets hotter. The air is a gas, and hot gasses expand, all the molecules of air get farther apart. In weather terms this is called a low pressure area. \n\nSo in the hotter area the molecules of air are far apart from one another and the colder area has air with molecules packed tightly together. Imagine there are 100 people in a room with a fence running down the middle, 90 people are on one side of the fence and 10 people are on the other. The side with 90 people is really crowded, this is like the air above the colder area of the Earth.

      "696": "A dozen people already responded to this but I'm gonna anyway because I'm a know-it-all and pretty bored at the moment (and the rest of reddit sucks today). I'm gonna actually try to explain this using references from The Office:\n\n**Ponzi Scheme**:  A Ponzi scheme is when you ask someone for an investment and promise a huge or quick return on investment, then deliver on it by promising someone *else* the same thing and paying off the first person with someone else's investment.\n\nExample: At lunch time, Dwight says to Ryan \"If you give me your pudding, I'll give you two puddings tomorrow.\" Ryan agrees, and gives Dwight his pudding. Dwight then goes to Phyllis and Stanley and says the same thing. They both agree. Now Dwight has 3 pudding packs, eats one, then the next day gives the other two from Phyllis and Stanley to Ryan to follow through on his promise. Ecstatic about his return on investment, Ryan is more than happy to give Dwight even more pudding containers. He gives Dwight 5, Dwight eats one and gives the other four to Phyllis and Stanley as a return on his promises to *them.* They too are happy with the return on investment, and invest even more pudding packs in the hopes of doubling their investments. In order to sustain this, Dwight needs to continuously get more people to give him their pudding to pay off his debts to others while simultaneously taking a pack for himself each time. \n\n**Pyramid Scheme**: The classic red flag of a Pyramid scheme is when someone who is looking to \"hire you\" tells you you need to \"invest in your future\" or that you have to \"spend money to make money.\" The days of a recruitment pyramid scheme are falling to the past because people have caught on to the premise of basically investing in nothing. So nowadays to keep it legal, Pyramid schemes have to offer some kind of tangible thing which is usually something pretty petty or worthless / has marginal value. Basically what this is is a system where one person at the top recruits a bunch of people who invest in something and they only see a return by getting more people to invest in it through them. The closer to the top of a pyramid someone is /the more people you have beneath you, the more money you make.\n\nExample: Phil drives a corvette, and Michael wants to know the secret to Phil's success. Phil tells Michael he's made a fortune selling calling cards, tells him they are the wave of the future and that they sell themselves. He tells Michael that the *real* secret, though, is to buy a bunch of calling cards and then sell them to other people who can then sell them for him. Makes complete business sense, right? After all, you're just being a middle man. That's how Michael justifies his investment in calling cards; the only catch is that Phil wants Michael to cover the full costs of the calling cards that Michael purchases from him, and then Phil gets a percentage of Michael's profits from what he sells. In order to make money back, the *quickest* way isn't to actually sell the calling cards but to recruit Ryan, Jim, Toby and Stanley to buy them in large quantities *from him* with the intention of making a fortune selling them themselves after making a large initial investment, with Michael also taking a percentage of their profits and as a result Phil making a percentage of their profits transitively. The higher up you are on this pyramid, the more you are making off of the people beneath you. Regardless of whether or not they actually sell any calling cards, the \"initial investment\" on the part of the recruit/salesman is where the people higher up in the pyramid really make money.\n\n**Matrix Scheme**: This is when you pay a small amount to be on a list of people who could win something significantly more valuable than your initial investment. The more contributions you make, the higher your odds become of being the person who wins the larger prize.\n\nExample: Dwight, being the scheming assistant to the regional manager that he is, has some shady ways of being the best salesman at the office. His secret is the matrix scheme. He calls clients who are interested in getting a brand new Sabre printer. Unfortunately for clients, Dwight knows that he can make more money profiting off of hope than profiting off of printer sales. Dwight tells his client that if they pay twice as much for printer *paper*, they will be placed on an exclusive list of people who can receive a FREE Sabre printer. Can you hear him saying \"What if I told you you could receive a FREE Sabre printer just by buying more paper?\" But there's a catch: there are about 20 clients ahead of them on that list. The more orders of overpriced paper they place through Dwight, the closer to the top of the list they get. Eventually one of the clients receives a free printer, meanwhile Dwight has sold so much paper at such a high profit margin that the cost of that free printer is insignificant.",
      "697": "When you look at a surface like sand, bricks, etc, the light you are seeing is reflected by diffuse reflection.\n\nWith a flat surface like a mirror, light falling on the surface is reflected back at the same angle it hit the surface (specular reflection) and you see a mirror image of the light falling on the surface. However a material like sand is basically lots of small grains of glass, and light is reflected at all the surfaces of the grains. The result is that the light falling on the sand gets reflected back in effectively random directions and the reflected light just looks white.\n\nThe reflection comes from the refractive index mismatch at the boundary between between air (n = 1.004) and sand (n ≈ ≈  1.54). Light is reflected from any refractive index change. So suppose you filled the spaces between the sand grains with a liquid of refractive index 1.54. If you did this there would no longer be a refractive index change when light crossed the boundary between the liquid and the sand, so no light would be reflected. The result would be that the sand/liquid would be transparent.\n\nAnd this is the reason behind the darkening you see when you add water to sand. The refractive index of water (n = 1.33) is less than sand, so you still get some reflection. However the reflection from a water/sand boundary is a lot less than from an air/sand boundary because the refractive index change is less. The reason that sand gets darker when you add water to it is simply that there is a lot less light reflected.\n\nThe same applies to brick, cloth, etc. If you look at a lot of material close up you find they're actually transparent. For example cloth is made from cotton or man made fibres, and if you look at a single fibre under a microscope you'll find you can see through it. The reason the materials are opaque is purely down to reflection at the air/material boundaries.",

That box when extracted by a processor will generate 5.5 to 6.0 gallons of orange juice.

Valencia, Parson Brown, \"Pineapple\" oranges and Hamlins are the main varieties of oranges used in Florida to make OJ in processing plants. Extractor do not \"grind up the fruit\". There are 2 types of extractors .... one \"reems\" the fruit like you do at home and the objective of the reem is to get all of the juice, pulp and inside of the orange without impacting the white interior of the fruit (albedo) which is very bitter.

The pressed liquid is run through an evaporator to turn it into molasses and added back to the cattle feed to sweeten it up.\n\nA comment in the string says \"don't let them tell you they don't add water because they do\". They don't add water to not from  concentrate Orange Juice .... it is against the law and no reputable brand would do this.\nThe cost of the oranges is so different because when you buy table fruit it is at most a bag .... processors sign contracts to buy whole groves of oranges .... sometimes buying millions of 90 lb boxes at a time.

This is why outside of a club you can hear the bass, but not the vocals. Sonar uses this property to send signals far through the water and even below the ocean floor to search for oil deposits, and even look for objects in the water such as submarines, old shipwrecks, and even tracking marine life. Much the same as bass from music doesn't physically hurt you (you can sense it and it can be uncomfortable and annoying), low frequency signals don't hurt whales - they just scare them.\n\nSo that's great! These low frequency signals are just scaring the whales, and they surface too quickly essentially giving them the bends right? Why are whales so dumb and just leave slower? Well, the answer to that is: whales aren't that dumb. A scary noise doesn't cause them to surface so quickly they hurt themselves, there is a bit more to it than that. We have to talk about *how* we generate sonar signals to understand why whales are surfacing so quickly.\n\nThe downside to low frequency signals is that they take a *lot* of power to generate. In fact, the only reliable way we have to do this right now is through the use of air guns (which compress a column of air and then releases it underwater), or explosives. Both of these methods have the unwanted side-effect of generating very loud broadband (or \"all frequency\") noise. This means the whales hear very loud signals in their hearing range, which very similarly to us can cause pain and deafness. It's these signals that cause pain that cause the whales to surface too quickly, because they find themselves in a lot of discomfort. \n\nAnother downside of this is that most whales use a form of bio-sonar to search for food - they \"clap\" their blowhole together very rapidly and listen for echoes to find krill and other food sources. This loud noise can deafen the whales, which effectively blinds their bio-sonar, and then they starve to death.\n\nSo, the best solution for this is to develop some sort of source that can generate low frequency signals, without generating the high-frequency portions. An underwater sub-woofer if you will. This would give us the penetration power of the low frequency signals without causing whales actual discomfort. While it may have other effects (such as diverting whales away from a mating area), it would be much less impactful than our current solutions. There is a lot of research in this field, but there are no commercially available products just yet.\n\n**ELI5**: Sonar surveying is not the problem, its the side effects of generating the signals required for surveying that is. Normally, scary noises would just cause them to leave at their own pace, however the side effects of our scary signal generation causes whales discomfort and pain as well, which is why they surface so quickly.\n\nSource: I work as a Sonar R&D scientist in Canada",

The longer you do this the closer to pi you'll get.\n\n**Edit**\n\nAlot of people asked for the GitHub repository, here it is:\n\nhttps://github.com/pnadon/PresentationExamples\n\n- the actual methods are in the PresentationExamples file, the first being the standard buffon's needle simulation, the second being the same with the exception of not using cos or pi, and the third is an example of Monte Carlo integration.\n\n- main basically gives you the option of which to run, and then automatically prints out the time taken to run the simulations, the result, and the standard deviation.",

      "722": "Trains can be extremely heavy, this weight is focused upon the fairly small area of their wheels. The stones are actually called *track ballast* and help to spread the huge force from the train's wheels out over a larger area of ground. Without this ballast the ground underneath might sink unevenly. The sleepers (*cross ties*) of the tracks are not directly attached to the ballast which allows the track to have a little movement (e.g. as the track expands and contracts due to changes in temperature).\n\nStones are a good choice for this role because:  \n1. They are cheap.  \n2. They can resist compressive loads well.  \n3. Relatively low maintenance.  \n\nAlso of note: ballast is itself built upon a foundation of earth (the *subgrade*) that helps to raise the track and further distribute load.\n\nOther functions: stops plants growing around the tracks, allows water to drain away.\n\nAre rocks a significant derailment hazard? Not really -- trains are massive and move quickly -- this enormous momentum means they smash right through most anything in their path. Rocks are typically turned to dust by the wheels of the train or thrown out of the way by the tremendous pressure of the wheels against the track.",
      "723": "OP I think you're misunderstanding the concept of a dimension in the first place. There is no such thing as the 'first' dimension. Once you decide you've got a particular number of dimensions (usually 3 if we're talking about things in physical space) they're all indistinguishable. So what is a dimension? Well the number of dimensions simply specifies how many numbers you need to tell where a specific point is: on a flat piece of paper you need two numbers, the first number could refer to how far to move along and the second to how far up but there's no reason it needs to be this way; you could just as easily describe that point by its angle to the horizontal and how far it is away from some specified point. Whatever way you want to describe it though, you always need two bits of information so the flat surface is 2D. \n\nEdit: I'll try and flesh this out to have a go at the 11 dimensions bit.\n\nFirst off, dimensions beyond 3 spatial and 1 time are theoretical. There's still disagreement among string theorists over the number of extra ones they'd like: supergravity has 7 more spatial ones but i've heard the number 26 thrown around as well. I don't think there's any way to intuitively understand why those numbers should be what they are, its just the way the (very) complicated maths works out. As to why we can't move in these extra dimensions, the classic explanation is that they're curled up very small. This is like if you look at a straw from a long way off: it looks like a line (so 1D) but actually you could move around its surface so to describe where a dot on a straw is you would need two numbers.",
      "724": "To complete and go more in depth on what was already answered, it is a mix of influences from genetics and environmental conditions (as for everything in biology actually). A stem or a branch usually end with a bud (called apical bud) which contain a special group of cells called a meristem. Meristems are where cell multiplication happens in a plant and so are what allow a plant to grow. During the growth season, this apical meristem will produce new cells at the base of the bud and those cells will then elongate, which will make the branch grow longer. As others said, this process is controlled by hormones (the principal one being called the auxin), and those hormones are strongly sensitive to the environmental conditions. For example, light destroy the auxin, which will make the shadowed side of a stem grow more than the other side and the stem will \"go\" toward the light source.\nEvery now and then during this period, the meristem will produce a leaf and on the top of the junction between the leaf and the branch, a little piece of meristem will separate to create a new bud (called axillary bud). This bud will stay dormant until the next growing season (where there is different seasons) and then it will start to be active the same way as the apical bud (it actually is an apical bud at this point) and develop into a new branch. The rhythm and the places the leaves and the axillary buds will be produce is mainly controlled by genetics.\nSo to summarize, environmental conditions like light (but also wind, gravity, animal grazing,...) control the shape of the branches and where they go, and genetics controls when and where a new branch is produced.",
      "725": "It depends on the game, type of game, AI role, etc.\n\nIs there a particular game or character you want to know more about?  I'll try to give a brief overview of a few topics (as I started explaining this, it became clear it was going to be long).\n\n**Pathfinding:** This is a big one.  Imagine a game like Starcraft, Warcraft 3, DotA, LoL, or any other game where you pick a unit/character/hero and tell them where to go.  How does it know the best way to get there?  Well, in an ideal world (the frictionless vacuum infinite plane world from high school physics class), they would just move in a straight line to the point.  Of course, this is often not the case.  Any interesting game will have impassible obstacles in the way or terrain that takes longer to traverse than others (maybe the unit has to pass through a thick swamp vs. a grassy plane, or the unit has to travel uphill).  One solution would be to calculate every possible path from every spot on the map to every other spot on the map, but this isn't always practical.  First of all, most RTS games aren't like a chessboard, but imagine that they are.  A chessboard is 8 spaces by 8 spaces for a total of 64 spaces.  Assuming there is a piece that can move any distance in any direction, each of the 64 squares will have 63 potential squares to which it can move in the most efficient way.  That means that you would have to pre-compute on the order of 64 choose 2 (or something, it's early here and I'm kind of hung over) which is over 2000 paths to compute, and that's assuming that there are no obstacles in the way and the piece can move through every square with equal ease.  Extrapolate that to a modern video game and the space-complexity of the \"board\" is far greater than 8x8.  In real life, the state-space will be continuous (there are an infinite number of positions that a unit can occupy), and it's close to that in modern video games, but not really.  Still, it is nearly continuous.  To counter this and simplify the problem, the game's programmers will discretize (approximate) the map.  The most common way of doing this is to introduce \"nodes\" on the map.\n\nA chess board is \"discrete,\" in that a piece must be on a square or off of it.  A piece can't be half-on/half-off, it can't be a quarter on/quarter off, and it can't be 3.14159265359... on a square.  Nodes take a continuous space and approximate positions on the map into discrete locations.  Obviously, the more nodes, the more realistic the approximation will be, but the computation will be more complex.  Ideally, the nodes will be distributed evenly.  At this point, the programmer can compute every path from every node to every other node, and on a modern computer, this won't take *too* long, but what if the terrain changes or a unit is in the way?  This is where the A* algorithm (pronounced \"A Star,\" which makes it very difficult to Google) comes in.\n\nA* is a very powerful algorithm that falls into the family of \"informed search.\"  An uninformed search algorithm will naively search every every possible outcome.  An informed search will use information from the current step to assess how good the solution is and make decisions based on that information.  This information is what is known as a \"[heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic).\"  A heuristic is an educated guess about how far away the solution is from a given state.  If the heuristic is admissible (tl;dr/ELI5: \"good\"), the solution is guaranteed to be optimal.  An admissible heuristic for pathfinding is usually [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance).\n\nSo let's dial it back for a second.  You're a unit, you know where you are, you know where you want to go, and you know what possible moves you can make from your current position.  You look at all of your possible next positions and rank them based on your heuristic.  Then, you take the best option from that list, compute all the possible moves from THAT position, rank them by heuristic, repeat.  If you run into a dead end, you go back to the previous list you generated and pick the second best option, and so forth.  Once you've found the best path, you take it.\n\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/mlSpcXw.gif) is a visualization (taken from the [Wikipedia article on A*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)) of the algorithm in action.\n\nThis is a powerful algorithm because it can be used for more than just pathfinding.  Any problem that can be made into a graph can usually be solved optimally with A*.\n\n**Decision-making:**  Any turn-based game will have decisions made each turn, but for a simple example, let's use tic-tac-toe.  Let's imagine an \"agent\" (artificial intelligence) playing the game at the outset as the \"x\" player.  At the beginning of the game, the agent has 9 options of where to place the first x.  Similar to A*, the agent can compute all 9 possible moves and how likely they are to garner a victory just based on the position of the first x alone.  The agent still needs a heuristic here, so it should probably value 3 x's in a row very highly, 2 x's in a row with two open spaces to complete the row/column/diagonal almost as highly, and perhaps give value to a single x in a given valuable square.  Now the agent has to consider the \"o\" player's turn.  For a good decision-making agent, it should assume the \"o\" player wants to make its decision based on what will be worst for the \"x\" player, so it should calculate all 8 possible placements of the \"o,\" decide which is worst for the \"x\" player, and assume it will make that move.  From here, the agent should calculate all 7 possible \"x\" placements, rate them, continue.\n\nThe astute reader should see at this point that the depth (in this case, how many turns) of this game and it's state space is 9 as there are only 9 spaces.  From the first turn, the first agent has 9 options, and every subsequent turn has one fewer, but in computer science, we care about the worst case, so that means that there is a \"branching factor\" (number of choices) of 9, and a depth of 9, giving 9^9, or 387,420,489, possible ways the game can play out (please check my math, again, early morning, hungover).  That sounds like a big number, but to a modern computer can handle that easily.  This means that it is possible to \"solve\" tic-tac-toe.  In this case \"solve\" means come up with a strategy that will always win/tie/play optimally given that the agent has the first move.  Most games are far more complex.  Consider a turn-based game like Civ5.  There is a huge number of options a player may choose each turn.  The number of options will determine your \"branching factor.\"  More on this later.\n\nConsider chess.  In 1996, an AI chess-playing agent called [Deep Blue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_%28chess_computer%29) beat chess world champion and grandmaster [Garry Kasparov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov) in Philadelphia (where I am right now, actually).  This is significant for a number of reasons.  For one, the movie *2001: A Space Odyssey* had a scene where Hal, the *Discovery's* AI, beats one of the astronauts in chess, and when I saw that movie for the first time (circa 2005), I didn't think twice about it, but in 1968 when the movie came out, this would have been a very sci-fi fantastical concept.  It's also significant because, while chess is almost sure to have a dominant strategy, it is not \"solved;\" the dominant strategy is not known.  The space-complexity of the game is also far more complex than tic-tac-toe, and that game had (on the order of) 387,420,489 ways in which it can play out.  Furthermore, the depth (number of turns) is potentially infinite, because it would be a legal move to have a rook move back and forth between two spaces indefinitely.  Exploring every single state and every single decision would be a HUGE computational burden, even for a modern computer.  A single knight has 8 possible spaces to which it can move (given that they are not occupied by one of the agent's own pieces or off the board), and the player has two of them.  A rook in a corner can move to 14 different spaces.  Any pawn can move on the first turn (or knight).  While I am not sure how \"Deep Blue\" handles this, my guess is that it uses some kind of \"Monte-Carlo\" approximation, in which it randomly selects a strict-subset (some but not all) of possible moves and explores the results of those rather than all of them.  The more states in your subset, the better your approximation, but this comes at the expense of computation time/resources.  This could be its own topic and I'm running out of characters, so I'll move on.\n\nThe definitive textbook on AI is Russel and Norvig's \"AI: A Modern Approach.\"  The cover of the book shows the final configuration of the chessboard when Deep Blue beat Kasparov with relevant pictures on the squares, including Alan Turing (if you haven't seen *The Imitation Game,* oh my God go see it even if you aren't a math/computer science person).\n\n[Here's the cover](http://i.imgur.com/UjU1Pmi.jpg).\n\n**Drama Management:** If you play Left4Dead, you've seen this one.  Have you noticed that if you're progressing quickly, the game starts throwing more and increasingly difficult enemies at you?  An AI is behind that.  This is so good players and bad players can enjoy the game equally.  If you are doing poorly, it goes easy on you.  If you're doing well, it gets harder.\n\nI don't know this for a fact, but I strongly suspect that \"The Last of Us\" uses a simple drama management agent to control how much ammo you have.  I've noticed that you never feel like you have a safe amount of ammo.  If you're out, you always find some, but you never seem to have a surplus. (con't)",

      "757": "Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) (IUPAC name: sodium hydrogen carbonate, *if you're a pedant*😉) has several chemical properties which are generally useful, and relatively few disadvantages.\n\n* Shortest Answer: It's cheap to produce and very chemically reactive, but won't melt your skin off or poison you.\n* The obvious one: It reacts strongly with acids, giving off CO₂ and water in the process. This is useful to turn certain baked goods from a solid mass of baked flavoured flour to a fluffy porous network filled with gas bubbles that you can actually bite through.\n* Although it's mildly alkali (\"base\" or \"anti-acid\") in solution, and reacts strongly with acids, it's actually an *amphoteric salt*, meaning it can react with alkalies as well as acids (though not quite as strongly).\n* Many (but not all) common chemicals associated with \"bad smells\" are volatile acids. When they react with baking soda, they are turned into less-volatile salts - they'll tend to stay solid instead of becoming a gas, and what little does evaporate is less \"smellable\" by human noses (it binds more weakly or not at all to scent receptors).\n* It's non-toxic (in quantities needed for functional results), so it can safely be used in food and on food-contact surfaces.\n* Despite being non-toxic in normal quantities, it can cause gastrointestinal distress in humans from released CO₂ if consumed in large quantities. Yet, for some insects (particularly cockroaches), this gas release can cause their internal organs to *explode*, if you mix baking soda with suitable bait.\n* It dissolves in *enough* water, but if there's not enough, it'll just get wet without fully dissolving. This makes it a mild fine-textured abrasive that can be used for scrubbing, which can still be rinsed away fully.\n* When it gets very hot, it starts to break down into simpler compounds and carbon dioxide. This reaction absorbs quite a bit of heat - so throwing it on a fire will *both* cool down the fire *and* drive away oxygen with CO₂.\n* The alkalinity breaks down pectins and hemicelluloses in plant cell walls - compounds which give plants rigid structure. Adding it to cooking water helps soften vegetables faster - particularly beans and pulses, which require longer cooking times to be edible. This used to be much more common for cooked vegetables in general, but too-mushy vegetables have fallen out of fashion, and baking soda has been found to accelerate the breakdown of vitamin C (an acid) and some other nutrients in cooking.\n* It interferes with protein coagulation - the ability of proteins to stick together and form a semi-rigid network. Gluten in flour is formed by is formed by two proteins, glutenin and gliadin, which stick together and form a stretchy network when hydrated and kneaded. Disrupting gluten network formation helps the texture of less-leavened or unleavened baked goods, as they won't be held together by so much gluten - they'll be more tender or even crumbly, depending on the amount used. (Also, this works on meat proteins, by making it harder for the protein to bind into a tough matrix while cooking.)\n* As an alkali, it can steal hydrogen ions from the amino acids in proteins, making them more chemically reactive. These \"deprotonated\" amino acids and proteins can then more easily react with reducing sugars, speeding up the \"Maillard Reaction\" - the tasty browning that happens on cooked meats and baked goods.\n* Many microoganisms and fungi can only survive in a limited range of pH. Baking soda works as a mild disinfectant/antifungal agent, by raising the pH beyond what the microbes/fungi can survive.\n* It's (currently) made out of carbon dioxide, common salt, and ammonia - three *very* common compounds. The process (Solvay) is relatively easy and inexpensive, as far as industrial chemical synthesis goes. If there was a \"baking soda cartel\" that conspired to raise the price of baking soda, they'd be easily outcompeted by any other manufacturer that charged even a little less. (Unlike, say, diamonds, which can be monopolized by controlling diamond-rich regions and investing in expensive processing equipment.) Eventually, the price would fall to the point of just barely covering production, distribution, wages/salaries, and factory maintenance.\n\n\n^(*Edit: Cockroaches won't explode as dramatically as I had previously ~~hoped~~ described.

Since computers use 8 bits per byte, you just split the 8 into 2x 4 bits, which can now be represented with 2 hex digits. For the HTML, you tell the computer that the next two characters are hex value by adding % before. (So %20 = 00100000).\n\nNow you know why space is %20, but why replace the space by %20?

When the lion jumps out of the bush, you don't want to sit down and puzzle out a 13-point action plan.\n\n~~These systems can be manually activated~~ You can help activate these systems by smiling and frowning. Smiling activates system 1, and this is thought to be evolutionary selection to help us get along socially -- quick banter, jokes, being in the moment, and paying attention to multiple things. Frowning activates system 2, and this is thought to be evolutionary selection for rumination -- when something is wrong in your life you need to stop and figure out what needs to change.\n\nActually it would be more accurate to say that (like many things in physiology) they're activated in a feedback loop. Using system 1 makes you smile which reinforces system 1 which makes you smile which reinforces system 1, and so on. Similarly, using system 2 makes you frown which reinforces system 2. We stay in system 1 most of the time because it requires very little mental energy compared to system 2, which becomes exhausted quickly. Our body is always trying to put us back into system 1; or more accurately, system 1 tends to automatically answer questions before system 2 ever gets a chance, and it takes deliberate effort to ignore your first instinct in favor of puzzling something out.\n\n**tl;dr We frown while concentrating because it helps us maintain our concentration. More specifically, it's a biological feedback mechanism for activating system 2.**\n\nKahneman wrote about the two systems in his best-selling book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, wherein he also goes into detail on the cognitive biases each system is susceptible to.

Common wrong terminology. \n\nYou have two flaps of very thin membrane that sit in the middle of your larynx. They vibrate extremely quickly when you bring them together and send air through them to produce sound. Very much like a trumpet player’s lips into a trumpet. \n\nHowever your folds don’t just vibrate like a cell phone, they wave along each other. It’s super interesting in slow motion.\n\nAnyways, swelling on your folds prevents the perfect closure of these very thin pieces of tissue. The larger the swelling, the harder it is to force the two sides together. Most people lose only parts of their voices because they can still make their folds vibrate together at lower frequencies that require less vibration and the folds are still able to come together despite the irregularity. But if the swelling (or in severe cases, the growth) on your vocal folds is large enough it can prevent you from talking at all. \n\nSwelling is caused the same way as any other swelling. From impact. Every time you speak your folds come together. But if you yell they can come together more violently. When you cough or clear your throat, your folds come together VERY violently. So losing your voice is a product of swelling created by friction, not by any kind of phlegm or other obstruction. \nEdit: you can also have swelling on your folds from the infection itself as someone pointed out, but you can prevent this from worsening, and also allow it to heal faster by not coughing.\n\nIm an opera singer, and when I get sick my main goal is to prevent myself from coughing. The less I cough during an illness, the faster my vocal folds will recover afterwards. \n\nWhen smokers lose the ability to speak, it’s usually because one or both of their folds becomes paralyzed, or has to be removed. And since you can’t force one of your vocal folds all the way to the other side of your throat, it’s impossible to make vibration and therefore no sound. \n\nReason I know: I’m an opera singer who has taken multiple vocal science classes. I also once suffered an impact to the throat that made it impossible for me to speak for 6 weeks due to a massive bruise on my vocal fold.",

The range of missing colors (like magenta, bright purples, oranges etc) arent often needed in paintings of natural subjects.\n\n>What exactly makes CMY(K) superior to the RYB model?\n\nIt's \"superior\" because you can create more colors with that system. As others have said- you can mix M with Y and C to make R and B and many other colors you can't get with RYB. RYB makes \"muddier\" colors. I put superior in quotes because many painters still use an RYB palette, because it's easier to make those duller, earthier colors. Modern printers need to make ALL the colors though. \n\n>And why did yellow stay the same when the other two were updated?\n\nThey just had yellow correct from the beginning.

Remember that one time you felt sick after eating seafood on that really long car ride? Well now maybe just eating and being in a moving vehicle triggers your anxiety.\n\nIt's very common for people who have anxiety to also have obsession disorders, and it's a cyclical thinking that will continuously trigger the attacks.

But you keep thinking about trying to sleep, more anxiety. \n\nThere doesn't even need to be external trigger either. There is a lot of evidence for people who are very sensitive and in tune with their bodies to get frequent attacks.

It explains the golden ratio, what we mean to say it's the \"most irrational\" number and how it's relevant to plants (the specific example given is with sunflower seeds).\n\nSo i'll try and break it down in a couple of sections. \n\nFirst off, why do plants \"choose\" this number to begin with? The video I linked explains that the plant in question (the sunflower) tries to lay out its seeds in the densest possible way. This is important as it's beneficial for the plant to get the most seeds in the least possible area as it then uses less energy for the same task. So starting on the inside and growing out, let's say we place one seed every 1cm from the centre but we can choose how far to turn with each seed placement. If we take one full turn every time we place our seed we grow in a straight line. Once every 1/2 turn and we grow in 2 lines, once every 1/3 and we get 3 lines growing out from the middle. You should see the pattern. None of these are very efficient. We want to find a number which generates the least number of straight lines as this guarantees that we're taking up the least space as straight lines imply that there's area we're not using for seeds. That's where the golden ratio comes in.\n\nThe golden ratio is what we call an \"irrational number\", an irrational number is a number which cannot be expressed in the form a/b where a and b are whole numbers. But the golden ratio is special, it's a number which is the *least well approximated* by two integers a/b. Simply put, if we want to get an approximation for the golden ratio to a certain number of decimal places then it's guaranteed that a and b will both have to be larger than if we were to try and approximate another irrational number to the same accuracy.\n\nIn the first bit we see that 1/3, 1/2 and 1/1 all produce straight lines and so we know that having our ratio in the form a/b is not a good choice. We now also know that the golden ratio is least well approximated by a/b where a and b are whole numbers. Connect the dots and we see that the golden ratio produces the least amount of straight lines and so is the best number for packing these seeds densely :). The golden ratio also has many uses in nature besides this example but you can often boil it down to being the most irrational number.\n\nThis is from memory so the explanation might be slightly butchered. The video I linked provides a bit more of an in depth explanation as to how we know the golden ratio is the most irrational as well as some fantastic animations showing the sunflower choosing different numbers.",

      "825": "Cholesterol is a building block for hormones (like testosterone and estrogen) as well as a huge component of the membrane that surrounds cells (cells are the building block of organs/tissues and the membrane is like the wall that defines the cells).\n\nWhen you get your cholesterol measured you measure fat and cholesterol carriers not cholesterol itself, namely you measure what's called LDL, HDL and VLDL mainly which are made of proteins, cholesterol and fatty acids primarily. These are just based on density you see if you suspend them all in a tube (low density lipoprotien, high density lipoprotien and very low density lipoprotien). \n\nBasically when you eat stuff your intestines absorb the good stuff (amino acids which make up proteins, fats, sugars and cholesterol). Unfortunately unlike amnio acids and sugars, fat doesn't dissolve that well in water (thus blood since blood is 55% water) so the body makes droplets of fat (think like droplets of oil) and to make it dissolve better it packages cholesterol in it which is kinda like soap in that it is partially soluble in water and partially soluble in oil. When it initially is from the intestines it's termed a chylomicron which goes to liver and then is reformed to VLDL which is simply a repackaged lipid droplet from the liver. Liver always gets first dibs on anything you eat because of a direct blood flow from intestines to it. VLDL gives fats to tissues and becomes IDL and it also picks up cholesterol from the tissues and that then gives away its proteins to a precursor HDL and in the process it essentially becomes LDL (it also picks up cholesterol from the HDL).\n\nLDL has a main function of bringing cholesterol to the tissues from the liver (which gets it from our diet) while HDL has the opposite function of bringing cholesterol from tissues to the liver. You need both since we definitely need to bring cholesterol to tissues but we also need to pick up excess cholesterol from cells, maintaining optimal levels are key.\n\nNow LDL has been implicated in contributing to atherosclerosis and that is a more complicated and less understood mechanism but essentially you Want to keep both HDL and LDL levels optimal. If you have too much LDL it can oxidize in your blood vessels and cause the formation of foam cells which cause them to inflame and get narrower so circulating blood gets harder so your body raises blood pressure to compensate (kinda like drinking water through a compressed straw vs a non compressed straw, you need more force through the compressed one) and to do this your heart beats harder and you can get more damage to your vessels and other complications.\n\nTLDR: LDL and HDL are what you measure when checking cholesterol levels, too much and too little is bad because you need cholesterol for a lot of stuff but too much can lead to a whole host of other issues like heart disease.\n\nSource: 3rd year Biomedical science student that is currently studying for a metabolism final\n\nEdit: Guys I'm not a doctor, while I appreciate that you find me informative and are looking for advice, I'm not qualified to give medical or nutritional advice.

      "849": "I'm sorry but most of the explanations on here or partially or completely wrong. I am a vet student focused on equine medicine and was just recently discussing this with one of my professors who is a renowned equine surgeon and has cut open more horses than most people have ever seen.\n\nThere are several reasons:\n\n1. Horses are pretty weird anatomically - they have no muscles below the knee. Part of their ability to run super fast is this really incredible tendon/ligament system - muscles higher on the body load the tendons and ligaments with huge amounts of power (picture a spring). Because of this, the bones in their lower leg (which is almost always where they break) are relatively very thin but also generating massive power. This ratio is much more extreme in the horse than other animals, so it means that solving it with a few pins like you might in other animals won't do the trick. In addition, this massive power makes it more likely that the horse will basically shatter the bone rather than just a simple break or fracture . Also, they're just really big.\n\n2. u/cantcountnoaccount described foundering well - if the horse can't move his legs around, he can't circulate blood through properly and it somewhat pools in the hoof and the attachments of the hoof to the bottom of the leg weaken. Compare this to a human or dog, where we can wiggle our toes and whatnot to help move circulation through - remember, horses have no muscles below the knee.\n\n3. Trying to keep a horse from moving around for any extended period of time is a nightmare. There's a saying I heard that all horses have two goals in life: homicide and suicide. They will colic and die if a bird looks at them wrong. In addition to the possibility of foundering, a horse is pretty likely to just lose his marbles if you try to keep them sedentary for too long - they may try to climb out of their stall, break whatever apparatus they're in, colic (severe and sometimes fatal stomach ache), get ulcers and whatever else. You can't force them to lay on their side for very long at all - they're too heavy and will have difficulty breathing and damage nerves.\n\nWhen deciding whether or not to save an animal, quality of life must always be considered. A dog may do perfectly well and have a wonderful life in a cast for a while and then with a moderate limp - this is not true for horses. Further, cost can be very prohibitive; it's worth it for very very expensive horses (think Barbaro) but for your average pleasure horse, the cost and pain is just not worth it or generally feasible.",

Quad core tablets are competing with all the other tablets, phones, laptops and etc. \n\nGraphing calculators are REQUIRED- usually in certain standard types like the TI-83, for all sorts of educational classes- starting with high school algebra and going through high level college courses. \n\nYour teacher doesn't want you using Johnny's Graphing Calculator because it won't have the identical TI-83 interface, meaning they'd have to spend a lot of time just telling you what buttons to push instead of teaching the math with a graphing calculator as a tool.  This then means that everyone knows how to use a TI-83, but no one can use the HP 1001. So they keep and buy TI-83s.\n\nEssentially the same reason college textbooks are so expensive.

      "857": "EDIT - As others have noted below, I totally forgot to include Macular Degeneration in this list, which is indeed a common cause of worsening vision.  Glaucoma has also been included below.\n\nGet a yearly eye exam, folks!  Even if you don’t wear glasses or contacts.  Many diseases can betray their presence in the condition of your eye tissues long before you start to notice any symptoms.  A good ophthalmic exam can help you catch it early and increase your chances of positive treatment outcomes!\n\n___________\n\n\nMost common causes of worsening eyesight:\n\nREFRACTIVE ERROR\n\nYour cornea (the clear part at the front of your eyeball) fails to bring light to a single-point focus on your retina (the rear inner layer of your eye that absorbs light).  This can be because your cornea becomes situated too close or too far from your retina as your eye grows and develops, or because your cornea is not “sphere” shaped (think more like “American football” shaped).  Glasses and contact lenses are made to correct refractive error.  Refractive surgeries like Lasik or Photorefractive Keratectomy have also proven very effective in correcting refractive error.\n\nPRESBYOPIA\n\nYour crystalline lens (a flexible component of the eye that sits right behind your iris) becomes less flexible as you age.  You have little muscles inside your eye that squash and stretch this lens to allow you to focus your vision on near and far objects.  As the lens stiffens, your focusing ability decreases.  This happens to literally everyone, usually around age 40.  Reading glasses are made to correct presbyopia.\n\nCATARACTS\n\nThe fibers in the crystalline lens begin to “fog over” and become opaque.  This can happen for a variety of reasons, many of which are age-related.  Cataract surgery is an amazingly quick and easy process nowadays, and the procedure replaces your foggy lens with a clear synthetic lens. \n\nGLAUCOMA\n\nThis is a condition where the optic nerve itself becomes damaged, inhibiting its ability to transmit information to the visual cortex.  This is most often caused by excessive intraocular pressure (pressure of the fluid in the anterior chamber of the eye, between your cornea and your lens).  Untreated glaucoma can cause significant, unrecoverable visual field loss, and even total blindness, so it must be monitored closely.  Glaucoma is insidious because it can progress painlessly and go unnoticed for months or years, silently robbing you of your sight.  Acute glaucoma is sometimes indicated by a severe headache and blurred vision.  You may also see halos around sources of light, or feel nauseated.  If you ever experience these symptoms, *don’t wait!*  Drop what you’re doing and go to an emergency room *immediately.*  Every second counts.\n\nKERATOCONUS\n\nYour cornea begins to “droop” downwards, like a water balloon rather than a sphere.  This adversely affects vision, because your cornea does most of the work focusing light into your eyes.  Keratoconus is corrected using hard contact lenses, which help the cornea retain a proper shape, a bit like a Jell-O mold.\n\nSOURCE:  I used to be a CPOT.

      "864": "Former game dev here,\n\nAssets (art, models, and music) take up the majority of the memory of any game. Ocarina of Time didn't have a lot of assets. Many of the models are low polygon by today's standards and few are textured (graphics applied to the model surfaces).\n\nMuch of the coloring is polygon coloring and gradients, and that's been hardware accelerated since about the time hardware acceleration existed; the hardware driver combined with the video processor instruction set can fill in the video buffer with simple colors and gradients when it fills the polygons. If you look at the screenshots, you'll see that the colors are mostly flat and simple.\n\nSome of the textures, looking at screenshots, look to be generated. Procedural generation is a technique where you let program instructions compute the texture at run-time instead of having to store a graphic file. Such textures are algorithmic patterns, and you can make a lot of patterns this way. There are a few iconic \"noise\" functions that generate patterns with interesting properties that have their own name, brown noise, white noise, perlin noise... And you can use a small hand full of these patterns to produce grass, hair, water caustics, clouds, rocks, wood, and more.\n\nIt's a bit more of a modern technique to generate these textures right in the video buffer during rendering; back in the day especially, but still today, too, it would be more common to generate these graphics in a texture buffer, and then apply that to the model. The whole point is that you can store the instructions to generate a texture (bytes) in less space than you can store the texture itself (several megabytes). Artist drawn textures are saved for where they're really needed.\n\nAnother example of this technique is Final Fantasy 7. The backgrounds are HUGE and highly detailed graphics while the models are 99.999% polygon art. The *only* texture applied to any of the models were the eyes.\n\nMusic undergoes the same procedural compression. That's basically what MIDI is all about. It's a series of \"vectors\" that indicate a direction and a magnitude, and equations that describe the waveforms of instruments. You just can't beat the size of synthesizer data with compression techniques. Of course, the quality of the audio is limited by the quality of the synthesizer, and there are just some things that can't easily be synthesized.\n\nCandy Crush, by contrast, is all artist assets, specifically BITMAPS. That means there is a definite value for every pixel in the graphic, and the graphic is a fixed size. If you want to scale the graphic to be bigger or smaller, you have two options: you either interpolate the graphic in a scaling algorithm which will inevitably result in noise artifacts, making the graphic unacceptably pixelated and ugly in a hurry, or you store multiple versions of the same graphic for every resolution your game supports. Guess which technique King decided to go forward with...\n\nThe problem is especially bad for mobile devices like Android phones or Apple products. For a given platform, they have one program release, and that single program has to support every device and their native resolution, so the vast majority of the content in that program will never be used, and the program doesn't have the ability to dump the graphics it will never use, nor is it desirable in case the hardware changes and the install doesn't. The iPhone version, for example, has graphics support for every iPhone, every tablet, and everything that runs iOS and OSX, since these apps also run native on your laptop.\n\nThey could potentially use vector graphics, as those are instructions that tell a render engine how to draw a 2D graphic; they scale perfectly, but vector graphics are notoriously slow because they require many many instructions and layers if you want a high level of detail. To render vector graphics in situ would be infeasible. They could instead pre-render vector graphics into a texture buffer as I suggested Ocarina did, but we're talking different levels of complexity here, noise is extremely fast to generate, vector graphics aren't. The load times would be unacceptable.\n\nThe other thing to consider is that memory copies are more energy conservative than CPU cycles on mobile devices, so they'll gladly sacrifice your storage space for battery life. I don't know if MIDI would be cheaper on a mobile device than decoding compressed audio, but I've never seen a game use compressed audio (whenever I've looked, at least). This spares CPU cycles for rendering, and on mobile devices, again, saves battery life. On a PC, we consider memory to be basically infinite, so there's no need to conserve memory, and compression loses quality, which we don't want. MIDI is employed where there is hardware acceleration on platforms with limited resources, otherwise there is no need to bother.",
      "865": "UV light can bleach pigments. The part of a molecule that is responsible for its visual colour is called the chomophore. When we say a pigment has been bleached, the chromophore has been chemically changed in such a way that disrupts its ability to absorb/reflect light in the way that causes its colour. The pigment could have been physically broken up by the UV light, or a slight change in the structure has changed the chromophore. \n\nSome pigments are more resistant to this damage than others, this is called \"light fastness\". You can get more resistant pigments (intuitively called resistant pigments) which can last longer or fade to a lesser extent. Different pigments can have vastly different structures (a [Blue pigment](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/C.I.-Pigment-Blue-78#section=2D-Structure) compared to a [Red pigment](https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB5469587.htm) for example), and so will fade at different rates and to different degrees.\n\nCheap print such as newspapers etc are going to use the cheapest inks which will be using the cheaper pigments, and therefore fade in the sun quickly. Items such as posters and print for billboards etc that are designed to be exposed to the sun for significant periods should be printed from inks based on resistant pigments, this will ensure they last a lot longer before they fade (although they will fade eventually). it's highly unlikely that all of the pigments used on a print will have the same resistance and fade at the same rates.\n\nWhen they do fade at different rates, the strengths of the different inks used (Typically Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) are going to be changing relative to each other ([Imagine playing with the colour sliders in paint](https://i.imgur.com/asNpHW5.png)), so the colours will appear to drift as these different compounds are bleached at different rates.

The first part is the work it has to do for each 3D polygon (triangle) in the scene to determine which pixels that triangle covers. The second part is the work it has to do for each pixel to calculate the color and brightness of that pixel.\n\n**Transparent objects are demanding because they make the GPU process each pixel multiple times, multiplying the amount of work done in the per-pixel phase of rendering.**\n\n**Shadows are demanding because they make the GPU process each triangle multiple times, multiplying the amount of work done in the per-triangle phase of rendering.**\n\nWithout transparent objects, there is exactly one surface visible at each point on the screen (disregarding anti-aliasing). Therefore the GPU only has to calculate light and color for each pixel once. With transparent objects like fire and fog you can see multiple layers at each point on the screen, so the GPU has to calculate light and color for each layer at each pixel, then blend them together.\n\nTo draw shadows, the GPU has to draw the scene from the perspective of each light that casts shadows, just as if that light were actually another camera. It usually doesn't have to calculate any color from the light's perspective, but it still has to go through the process of drawing each triangle in the scene for every light.\n\nIt turns out that many \"demanding\" effects in video games are slow because they multiply some part of the work of drawing a scene:\n\n\nTransparency: Multiplies per-pixel work in the areas covered by transparent things.\n\nShadow Mapping: Multiplies per-triangle work (plus some extra work at each pixel).\n\nAnti-Aliasing: Multiplies per-pixel work at the edges of each triangle on screen.\n\nGlobal Illumination: Multiplies everything by everything else until your GPU catches on fire...\n\nIf that all sounds confusing, that's because it is. I can try to clarify if anything about my wall of text is particularly unclear.\n\nEdit: I should mention that the problem of drawing pixels multiple times is called \"overdraw.\"\n\nEdit2: I should also mention that \"duplicate\" work was probably a poor choice of words. It's not redundant, it just has to process the same point multiple times instead of just once.",

You first look where you think it should be, then you look a little to the side to actually view the object. I've become quite good at it and now look at most stars indirectly.\n\nEdit: Here's some additional info for people who want to know why this is. You have two types of cells in your eyes. Cones that are designed to detect color (three types) and rods that only detect brightness levels across a wide color range. Your brain mixes those two signals together to give you what you see. It's most important to see color in the center of your vision though so your eye has a concentration of those cones in the center of your vision and you detect color less well outside the center of your vision. This is also why when its dark everything seems to become black and white because the cones in the center of your vision can hardly see any light any more. (Think walking around with a dim night light, or when you wake up in the middle of the night without any lights on but can still see because of various dim sources of light.) The center of your eye has more cones than rods while the periphery of your eye has more rods than cones. Coincidentally, rods see best in the blue/green color range which is why you use red light to not destroy your dark vision as the rods don't see the red very well.",

(Polysomnograms)\n\nOne person's 10 hours of sleep is not equivalent to another person's 10 hours of sleep.\n\nThere are 4 established stages of sleep, categorized into REM or Non-REM. These are categorized by the patterns of your brain waves. However, if you have sleep problems (sleep apnea, bruxism, restless leg, etc etc) then you're not going to get the quality sleep that you need.\n\nSo if I sleep 10 hours but get 2 hours of REM sleep versus someone who can not get deeper stages of sleep (I've seen people with zero rem sleep during a night's study) then I'm going to be more 'refreshed'.  One thing to note is that the level of oxygen your body gets during your sleep.  When you have obstructive sleep apnea, your breathing passages in your neck get obstructed and literally start to choke you in and out of sleep. 1) You fall asleep to lighter stages of sleep 2) your air passage get obstructed by apnea and your oxygen levels drop 3) your brain kicks you awake 4) your stage of sleep gets reset and you can not reach deeper stages\n\nI've seen bad cases of apnea where people are having 'episodes' of choking 40+ times per hour.  This is the reason why you have some people who sleep 10-12 hours and feel even more tired. Imagine spending 10 hours everyday choking awake 40 times an hour where your oxygen levels drop dangerously.  Then imagine sleeping like that for 20 years. Sleep apnea has also been linked to depression, memory loss, high blood pressure, heart disease, weight gain...\n\nA good example of good sleep: BABIES\nThey sleep at extremely high levels of oxygen intake (high 90's like 97-99%) they can also have deep sleep up to 50% of their sleep in REM (in adults it's usually around 15-20%)\n\nIt's all about the 'quality' of sleep you get.

      "903": "[This cheat sheet](https://imgur.com/a/APq2590) is a good very brief overview of what all the settings are.\n\nThe basic idea is this:  you want an image that is bright enough to see clearly, but not so bright that it's all white.  You have three knobs to control how much brightness you get.  Each affects the picture differently.\n\nShutter Speed:  Shorter times (like 1/2000) get you very little light, and longer times (like 30s) get you lots of light.  Shorter times also freeze action (because you're only gathering light over a very very short period, so nothing has time to move.  Longer times produce blur in anything that moves *even a tiny bit*.  Anything much longer than about 1/10th - 1/30th of a second, and you won't be able to hold the camera steady enough without aid (such as a tripod).\n\nSensitivity (ISO):  Lower numbers (like 100) mean less sensitivity, which means less brightness.  Higher numbers (like 6400) mean higher sensitivity, which means more brightness.  This is like boosting the gain on a microphone.  The more you turn it up, the more noise you get in your result.  Your image will look more \"grainy\" the higher you turn ISO.  It'll look like static is partially superimposed on your image.\n\nAperture (f-stop):  Lower numbers (like f/1.8) mean a wider opening and more brightness.  Higher numbers (like f/16) mean a narrow opening and less brightness.  Lower numbers (bigger opening) also allow more light that's coming in at odd angles, which will decrease how much of the image is in sharp focus (also called a \"shallow depth-of-field\").  Higher numbers (smaller opening) will cause more of the image to be in focus together.  That cool \"portrait mode\" thing that all the new phones do with their multiple cameras is simulating the effect of a wide aperture (low number) -- where the subject is in focus and everything else is a creamy blur.\n\nYou pretty much always want an image whose brightest points are almost-but-not-quite 100% white, and whose darkest points are almost-but-not-quite 100% black.  You can play with these three adjustments in different ratios in order to achieve that, but you'll get a very different image depending on how you combine them.  That's the artistic part!",

      "911": "Radiation damage is basically completely random: it goes through your body and when it hits a molecule, it breaks it into pieces.\n\nIf that molecule was something not too important (e.g. part of a cell's outer hull) and the pieces are by themselves not dangerous, then nothing much happens, the cell just cleans away the the pieces.\n\nIf the molecule was important for the functioning of the cell, or the pieces are harmful, then the cell is damaged and has to repair itself (which means it can't work properly for a while). If it is damaged too badly, it dies and has to be replaced. If too many cells are damaged, you die very quickly, but if it's not too many (but more than a few) you just get sick, but you recover - the \"latent period\".\n\nHowever, the radiation also damages the DNA (a very large molecule), the \"blueprint\" which cells need to reproduce and be replaced (also to create stuff for their daily work, but I'll skip over that aspect to keep things simple).\n\nSo if there has been to much damage to DNA, then cell reproduction will fail sooner or later or the new cells won't work properly. Your body cannot replace cells and instead produces garbage. This happens first with cells that are replaced quickly, such as the ones lining your digestive tract and the ones that let your hair grow. Eventually you die.\n\nThis is delayed because even the cells that are replaced quickly live for a few days, so it takes at least that long for the damaged DNA to show the full effect.",

Brain / spine / nerves / muscles : all of it.  \n\nELI5:  sleep- your brain is in control of your sleep:  brain monitors your body while in sleep:  any external stimulation or change or noise or cold or hot or anything:  the brain and body wake up and respond.  Your brain allows body to move while you sleep.  (Breathing, roll over in bed, flop you legs around when they get uncomfortable, pull the covers up if you cold, kick covers off if you get hot) \n\nGeneral Anesthesia:  anesthesia professionals monitor your sleep:  professional sedate your mind,  reduce your threshold for pain, and most of the time they relax your muscles.  Any external stimulation does not get registered by your brain and your muscles are relaxed so there is no response:  your body can not breathe on its own:  it can not roll over , can not pull up the covers, can not kick the covers off, and if you your blood circulation in your legs get reduced (like the feeling when your foot falls asleep ):  under general anesthesia your body will not be able to respond and adjust itself under general anesthesia:  that is why you have professionals monitoring and taking care of your anesthesia AND the neutral position of your body so your legs are not falling asleep because your ankles are crossed for several hours:  and yes:  we check all of that in surgery while you are asleep!  KEY Point:  it is controlled, monitored, and quickly reversible at end of your procedure. I.E. you wake up and return to normal function within a few min. Of time.  \n\nAlso:  different anesthesia drugs have different effects n EEG:  and any combo of drugs as well.  \n\nUnconscious:  ELI5 -  the the mind is protecting itself and your bodies vital organs only:  something caused the brain to go into critical status:  so instead of the brain monitoring every single body function while you sleep normally:  now it is only monitoring g the basic functions:  this is not controlled by an anesthesia professional:  and there are different levels of what the brain is controlling / functioning and what is not:  but the key point is the brain chooses to stop control over various body functions on its own (for whatever reason) and when the brain is ready to resume responsibility- it will resume control on its own:  (depending on level of trauma / damage / reason in the first place). Think about a choke hold from two kids playing rough and play wrestling- and one kid just holds the choke hold a bit too long and his friend passes out:  unconscious kid collapses and looses muscle control and tone:  then kid  starts to breathe as soon as the hold is released :  then the kid Opens his eyes within 5 seconds:  feels a little dizzy for 15 seconds:  then is back to normal.  This kid’s Brian only shut down a few functions and only for a few seconds:  this kid did not loose lung control, bladder control, blood flow to his extremities, blood glucose control, or any other major system control.  now think about the traumatic car wreck where patient is ejected from a vehicle and suffered massive blood loss and head trauma:  this patients brain will shut down several functions for a very long time while the body ( and brain) recover.  \n\nNow think of the patient that is actively having a seizure and looses consciousness.  This is electrical brain activity spikes that confuse the brain:   and it gets overloaded an has to shut itself down:  and even a 30 second seizure can cause bladder to empty, can cause vomiting, can cause the patient to bite his tongue off.  OR some seizures cause no muscle issues what so ever:  some seizures can happen to a girl sitting in her desk at school:  seizures can last 30 seconds:  and this girl will look to her classmates and teachers completely normal:  but the reality is her brain is resetting , her eye lids may be closed for 30 seconds, or she may appear to blinking rapidly for 30 seconds:  but she does not even slouch her head or shoulders:  she does not fall over, she does not loose bladder control and she does not vomit:  she does not bite her tongue:  she just sits still and silent for 30 seconds.  \n\nAll the examples I have given look different on EEG.

      "914": "There's a decent amount of misinformation in this thread, so I'll try to correct that as simply as possible. Railguns generally don't work by \"Electromagnets in front of the projectile pulling it forwards\" as another poster said. A Railgun is made up of two parallel rails, with a conductive projectile placed between them. The Rails are hooked up to an immensely powerful source of electricity which flows along the first rail, across the projectile,onto the second rail and back to the power source, creating a complete circuit. All circuits create electromagnetism relative to the strength of their current. The interplay of an Electric electric charge and a Magnetic field creates something called a Lorentz Force. This is the force that drives our projectile. Lorentz force follows something called the 'Right Hand Rule' which means if you curl your right hand to represent the rotation of the Magnetic Field, the Lorentz Force is exerted in the direction of your thumb, in this case the Lorentz force pushes the connected projectile forward along the rails down the barrel, continuously applied as long as the projectile is connected to the rails, causing the projectile to accelerate quite quickly. However, the Lorentz Force is quite weak, about .2 Micro-Netwons per amp. This means Railguns require a truly prodigious amount of electricity to operate",

If yes, turn off the heating element, and if not, turn it on.\n\nFuzzy logic can also express to what extent a statement is true on a sliding scale. Is the rice cooker hot enough? No, but it's close, so turn down the heating element a bit.\n\nIn a lot of control systems that extra information can be beneficial because it allows the control logic to make better decisions. In the rice cooker for example the heating element has a certain amount of thermal mass, and even if you turn it off, it will remain hot for a few moments and continue to heat the rice even without power going to it.\n\nThat means you will overshoot the desired temperature by a bit if you keep it powered at 100% until you reach the target temperature.

      "918": "Like many of the top commenters have said so far, \"libido\" is the cause of many different things.\n\nDopamine is a major factor. Drugs and activities whichc change the regulation of dopamine will alter libido. Dopamine agonists (pramiprexole), dopamine reuptake inhibitors (wellbutrin, cocaine, methamphetamine) will all cause increases in reward seeking behavior including but not limited to libido. Dopamine blockers such as antipsychotics are often considered libido killers.\n\nDopamine is counter-regulated by prolactin which is released after male ejaculation, so increases in prolactin cause dopamine and libido to drastically fall off. The other name for dopamine is prolactin inhibiting hormone, or PIH. Males who are able to ejaculate multiple times in a row with no refractory period tend to have a reduced production of or response to prolactin.\n\nTestosterone is a huge factor in libido for men and women. Testosterone acts as a neuromodulator and potentiates dopamineric activation of the sex drive. Interestingly, testosterone is decreased in men after drinking alcohol and increased in women.\n\nCholinergic function can also play a part. Anticholinergics can cause sexual dysfunction, acetylcholinesterates inhibitors can increase sexual function. The mechanism is thought to have something to do with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.\n\nMany people mention SSRIs. Since dopamine is generally excitatory and serotonin is generally inbihitory within the brain, it would make sense that SSRIs inhibit sexual function. The longer-term sexual side effects that come with SSRIs like post-SSRI sexual dysfunction probably have more to do with downregulations of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of dopamine in the brain.\n\nThere are a whole host of other psychopharmacological factors, but there are physical factors too.\n\nAerobic exercise increases heart rate, which in turn causes the body to produce vasodilators to reduce blood pressure. This causes better circulation which leads to more blood flow to the genitals and makes it easier to become aroused. If your body produces enough of these vasodilators, one of the main vasodilators, nitric oxide, can cause even more increased blood flow to the genitals. Nitric oxide is what ultimately gets altered from the use of viagra.\n\nAnaerobic exercise can do the same thing through the vasodilation mechanism. It also tends to boost testosterone. I'd imagine that the cascade of events which causes muscle to be built also includes some other things helpful to sex drive (BDNF, other growth factors).\n\nErection is mediated by oxytocin in the brain which activates the appropriate spinal nerves. If there are problems or alterations in the function of oxytocin then this can impact erection.\n\nPC muscle and bulbospongiosus tone/size/strength are also important factors. You can easily increase this with PC exercises. They are called [Kegel exercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise) and the pubococcygeus (PC) muscle is the main target. The more space is taken up by those muscles, it seems the less blood flow it would require to cause any given level of arousal.\n\nHigh doses of vitamin C can cause increases in arousal, but those are probably mediated by increases in norepinephrine which increases blood pressure, causing vasodilation in response. Other little things such as stimulant based asthma medicines likely have the same effect.\n\nThere's also the Coolidge effect, i.e., the effect of novelty on sex drive. Sex drive goes up dramatically with the addition of new partners and can take a dive with the same partner over time.\n\nThe quality and quantity of both sleep and food will have dramatic impacts on your sex drive as well.\n\nExcitation in the brain tends to increase sex drive. Inhibition tends to decrease it. This explains some of the effects of trainquilizers (GABA-A allosteric modifiers) on sex drive, as well as the effects of changes in progesterone, an allosteric modifier of the GABA-A receptor in women, across the menstrual cycle and its effect on sex drive.\n\nMany of these factors are altered in men vs. women.\n\nThen add in the psychological factors and people's life histories. The mind can change almost any reaction of the body. It gets very complicated very quick.\n\n**To answer your question** There are a lot of different factors that cause or are associated with libido changes. These neurochemical and lifestyle factors are dramatically different among different people. If you are having trouble with your libido, it could be any one of these factors or a host of others.

      "921": "Optical oceanographer here!\n\nThere's really two things that light does in the water once it hits anything floating in it (or even the water itself!). When light gets absorbed, it effectively \"colors\" the water. You see all the other colors that don't get absorbed. The other thing is scattering, which makes the water seem more turbid/less clear.\n\nYou can sum up everything that colors the ocean into five groups:\n\nWater: changes in the saltiness or the temperature will affect the scattering of light (and absorption if you could see in the infrared). \n\nBubbles: these highly scatter light and make the water seem white on windy days. \n\nAlgal particles: these are the phytoplankton! All combined, they equal primary production of every land plant. There are many many species, ranging in size from bacteria all the way up to visible diatoms. They absorb light like plants on land do, and, depending on their size, will scatter light as well. \n\nNon-algal particles: this is the category for living or non-living particles that don't do photosynthesis. This can include sediment from rivers, dead plankton, fish, etc. They mostly just scatter light, and absorb higher in the blue than in the red. \n\nCDOM: this stands for colored dissolved organic matter. Dissolved to us means that it goes through a 0.2 micron sized filter (1/5000th millimeter). I like to think of this as tea basically (technically tea is CDOM). You have this yellowish fluid leftover from leaves dissolving in the water (in the ocean's case, it comes from the algal particles above). \n\nThese five things interact to color the ocean in many different ways. We actually can model these to see how the biology, chemistry, and physics of the global ocean are changing! Then we apply them to ocean color satellites like Modis-Aqua or VIIRS to get a sense for how our oceans are changing over time!",

      "924": "Short answer....\n\nOk, I lied. It's not short. **TL;DR:** it comes from the Earth's rotation. First came hours (1/12 of daytime, or 1/24 of a full rotation), then minutes (1/60 of an hour), then seconds (1/60 minute).  Why those numbers?  Read on.\n\nPeople have always liked dividing things up into numbers that can be split evenly among groups of lots of different sizes. The most popular such number is probably 12 (dozens of eggs or doughnuts or muffins or cookies; larger pizzas are sometimes cut into 12 slices), since 12 things can be split evenly among 2, 3, 4, or 6 people (or 1 or 12, of course). \n\nSo historically, lots of things have been divided into 12 parts. There were originally 12 ounces in a pound (the word \"ounce\" comes from the Latin word for \"twelfth\"). And the day (sunrise to sunset, that is) was divided up into 12 parts, which we English-speakers now call \"hours\". (Who first did this - the Chinese, the Sumerians, the Babylonian conquerors of the Sumerians - is a matter of some debate.)\n\nPrecise time measurement is a relatively recent invention; hours, usually as determined by a sundial (meaning they weren't all the same length), were good enough for thousands of years. But when we started to need units smaller than hours, we again wanted to divide them up into a convenient-for-grouping number. You might expect that we would just pick 12 again and have 12ths of 12ths, but that's not what happened. Don't get me wrong; 12 is great - like I said, you can distribute evenly around a group of 2,3,4, or 6 - but you'll notice that list skips a number: 5. If you want to be able to handle 5 groups with a whole number of pieces each, you need to bump the total number of pieces all the way up to 12 *times* 5, which is 60. (Presumably for this same reason, those Sumerian/Babylonians I mentioned actually counted in base 60, which is related to how we got 360° in a circle.)\n\nSo the hour was divided into 60 parts, called the \"small part of the hour\". Eventually, of course, we needed even smaller pieces, so they renamed those as the \"first small part of the hour\", and divided them into 60 again, making the new smaller unit the \"second small part of the hour\". (And yes, there was also a \"third small part of the hour\", and at least some documented uses of even smaller subdivisions; but these days those have been replaced by decimal fractions of the second.)\n\nThose \"whateverth small part of the hour\" names are kind of unwieldy, however, so naturally they got abbreviated. Back when there was only one small part, it got abbreviated to just \"small\". When the second one came along, it was naturally abbreviated \"second\". Except all of the scientific writing where these units were first needed  was done in Latin, so the names were likewise Latin. From Latin for \"small\" we get \"minute\", and from Latin for \"second\" we get \"second\". \n\nSo that's the answer to your question: if you take the average day(time period in temperate zones) and divide it into 12, then divide those 12 parts into 60, and then divide those 60 parts into 60 again, you get the second. It's ultimately based on the Earth's rotation - a 60th of a 60th of a twelfth of a half of it, which is 1/86,400. In other words, on average, the Earth takes 86,400 seconds to make a full rotation with respect to the Sun. (It actually only takes about 86,164 seconds to rotate all the way around its axis, but since it has moved in its orbit in that time, it needs the extra 4 minutes or so to catch up so the same part of the Earth is directly in line with the Sun again.)\n\nBut the Earth is a lousy clock by modern standards - it wobbles due to all sorts of influences: gravity from the Moon, the asymmetrical effect of wind and tides on its uneven surface; basically, it's actual rotational speed is not consistent. So while its rotation is the ultimate source of the unit we call the \"second\", it's no longer part of that unit's definition. Instead, we have a much more precise definition based on counting cesium radiation emissions. Those emissions are impossible to predict individually, but happen very quickly - so fast that there are almost 10 BILLION with a B of them in a single second. Thanks to the law of large numbers, the amount of time required to collect such a huge number of emissions is amazingly consistent. Based on the number of emissions counted during the second as previously defined, we now define the second as the amount of time it takes to rack up 9,192,631,770 radiation cycles of cesium-133.\n\nBut we picked that number based on the previous definition, so the second is still derived from the Earth's rotation, even if it is no longer actually tied to it.",

      "927": "This has been answered accurately already so I'm gonna try to do a better job of explaining it to a 5 year old. \n\nWhen you talk, there are \"strings\" (not actual strings, more like folds) in your neck called vocal cords that make the talking sound. The faster they move (or vibrate), the higher the sound they make. Children's voices sound higher than adult voices because children's vocal cords aren't as big, so they're able to vibrate faster and make a higher pitched sound.\n\nThe same thing happens if you take that sound and play it even faster. You're artificially making the vibrations of the sound move faster so it sounds higher pitched. \n\nThis is true of any sound, not just voices. \n\n***Edit***: In case I simplified too much... here's a longer answer for anyone who wants to go a bit deeper, or who wants to complain about slight technical misunderstandings of what my simplified explanation meant:\n\nWhen vocal cords are smaller they naturally vibrate faster when air is pushed by them, which means the frequency of the audiowave pattern they produced gets repeated quicker. That's the frequency, which determines how high we hear its sound. The faster something vibrates, the higher pitched it is. \n\nYou do the same thing when you take a recording and run it faster. You increase the frequency of the audiowave pattern, so the pitch gets shifted up. \n\nSo the \"Explain it like I'm 18 and just haven't taken physics for some reason\" answer is that in audio, pitch = frequency, and frequency = wavespeed / wavelength. If you speed up the wavespeed without changing the wavelength, you get a higher frequency, which equals higher pitch. \n\nBut that answer had already been given when I wrote this, so I went for something a little more illustrative, and a lot of people seemed to find it more helpful.\n\n***Final edit*** For accuracy I adjusted some words and added some notes in parentheses. I originally talked about the length of the vocal cords instead of just overall size, which, while accurate, is not AS accurate, and just seemed to confuse the issue. ",

If there's water inside of a cell that falls into the honey, the honey will pull water out of the cell until the proportion of water to sugar inside the cell is equal to the proportion outside the cell.\n\nSince the honey had such a high sugar content, a single cell just doesn't have enough water in it to make a dent in that so the honey ends up pulling nearly all the water out of the cell, killing it in the process.\n\nThere are some things that can survive without any water; botulism spores have already been brought up and are a great example of why we pasteurise honey, despite how well it kills bacteria on its own.\n\nThere are other properties that play lesser roles like a chemical secreted by the bees called defensin-1 which works as an antibiotic but these other properties pale in comparison to the mighty osmotic pressure.\n\nWhat this means, though, is that, yes, honey has antimicrobial properties but the main one (osmosis) goes away the moment you dilute it because the balance mentioned earlier is much easier to reach if the overall solution has a lower percentage of sugar.\n\nIn turn, that means that honey does not pass it's abilities on to you by drinking it since you dilute it with your saliva and stomach acid.

      "937": "There are a lot of comments explaining the basic motor aspect of development and framing it as a pelvis size to baby head issue. This is one older theory that does not stand  up as well as another newer one (I’ve posted about it elsewhere on the thread but I’ll post it again). \n\nHuman babies are born developmentally premature for one main physiologic reason. There may be other non-physiological benefits (ie the socialization and language development during infancy that other primates do not devote energy towards). \n\nIt has less to do with pelvis size and more to do with the baby needing more energy (to grow its brain). While it’s true that babies heads would struggle to fit through the birth canal, there are other primates who have the same issue despite having relatively much smaller brains. This evidence may suggest that another factor besides size is at play. If you look at energy expenditures of the fetus, it happens to be that birth occurs at the moment they require more energy than they are getting via the placenta. They are essentially hungry for breast milk. This mechanism may be how birth is regulated in all mammals, but I only learned it in the context of human evolution. \n\nNow, there are two types of genes which are battling against each other: one to ensure the baby is small enough to be safely birthed, and one to ensure the baby is big and strong. Either the mother or father pass on one of these types, and there are common genetic diseases related to the malfunction of their expression. These would be Prader Willi (father gene turned off) or Angelman (mother gene turned off) syndromes. \n\nEdit: I’ve got a few minutes of free time, so I just wanted to expand on the last part: Prader Willi is characterized by children who have insatiable hunger. They lack their father’s gene (either being turned off or by having two copies of mom’s). This makes sense in the context of “genetic birth wars”; the mother gene wants the baby to be birthed sooner, so the fetus needs to feel hungry sooner. Angelman is not characterized by any hunger/satiety issues, but I’m not sure what this says about the genetic battle between Mom and Dad. ",

Stress is a threat to your well-being, so your body perceives this as danger. \n\nYour body prepares itself to protect you. It does this by releasing a hormone, epinephrine, aka adrenaline, into your bloodstream. Adrenaline constricts your veins and arteries, as well as increases your heart rate and breathing rate, so that oxygen rich blood can be delivered. It also diverts bloodflow away from the digestive system since its not terribly important right now (this causes the nausea). This is to prepare you to either fight the danger, or flee from it.

      "953": "The short answer is because in specialized cells, different segments of our DNA are turned on or off. \n\nFor a more detailed answer, we first have to understand what DNA is made of. \n\n**DNA**, the classic double helix, is a long chain of bases that stores code for making proteins.\n\nA **gene** is a length of DNA that codes for a specific protein. So one gene is dedicated to coding for the protein insulin, etc. Often many genes work together, for example there is evidence that as many as 16 different genes could be responsible for eye color in humans. \n\nA **genome** is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. However, genes, the protein-coding segments of DNA, only makes up about 2% of your DNA. The other 98% is called **noncoding DNA**.\n\nNoncoding DNA contains regulatory messages that are capable of activating, suppressing, and even silencing genes. For a gene to be used, it has to be transcribed first. \n\nThere are many ways that a cell can regulate if and when a gene gets transcribed. A very common method involves **transcription factors** and **promoters**. Promoters are stretches of DNA that can be recognized by a class of proteins known as transcription factors. These proteins interact with the DNA to begin transcription (or block them from getting started). To put it more simply, transcription factors help draw attention to, or away from, certain genes.\n\nIn different types of cells, some genes are turned off and others are turned on. This specific combination of activated genes is called **gene expression.** Gene expression is a highly complex and tightly-regulated process. The different roles of cells, and thus which genes become activated, occurs as cells mature when your body is being formed. \n\nThe mechanisms that induce a non-differentiated cell to become a specialized cell are very complex, and to be honest, poorly understood. In a laboratory setting, it is possible to induce immature cells to differentiate into specialized cells by changing the physical and chemical conditions of growth. There are a ton of different chemicals and proteins involved in cueing a cell to specialize, and I'd recommend these sources if you want to know more: \n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10061/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10061/)\n\n[https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/3-6-cellular-differentiation/](https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/3-6-cellular-differentiation/)\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/differential-gene-expression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/differential-gene-expression)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: \n\nCells differentiate themselves through **gene** **expression**.
