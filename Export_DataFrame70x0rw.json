Basically, these volatiles can act as infochemicals to signal other species (insects, nematodes, birds) that the plant is under attack. Predators and parasites of the herbivore in question have evolved/learned to follow the specific volatile compounds to find their prey. Parasitoid wasps, for example, might follow the chemical trail through the air to a plant being attacked by their host larvae. They can then lay their eggs in the larvae, which helps the wasp but may help the plant as well by decreasing herbivory over time.

I don't \"choose\" to believe it, the sources are out there, but if you have one that says otherwise I'd be glad to read it. Vegan sidekick has a good paragraph on it:\n\n&gt;First of all, if you're really serious about this and no amount of scientific evidence will sway you - then it purely comes down to numbers. If a blade of grass is of the same importance to you as a dog, then it makes no sense to feed up livestock on millions and millions of plants, and then kill the animal to eat. This would result in far more plant casualties, which you'd surely want to avoid as a dedicated plants-rights activist. Better to minimize those plant casualties by just feeding yourself on them, rather than feeding many times more to animals, right?\n\nBut let's be sensible - plants lack brains and lack anything else that neuroscientists know to cause sentience. Some studies show plants to have input/output reactions to certain stimulation, but no study suggests sentience or an ability to \"feel emotions\". You can plainly understand the difference between a blade of grass and a dog. Comparisons between the two are completely absurd.\n\nYou're reaching in that last paragraph, similar to asking a vegan \"But what would you do if you were stranded on an island?? You'd HAVE to eat an animal which means you're not vegan!\" We'll come to that conclusion when we get to it, but I'm going to worry about the billion and trillions of lives taken each year first before I worry about us finding aliens.\n\nThe logic of not eating animals because they have brains isn't flawed. There is a part of our brain that holds our empathy center. Since we have brains, feet, feelings, skin etc, just like all other animals, it's much easier to empathize with them than it is with plants. We're animals. And yes, some people who call themselves vegans (this is still up for debate) do eat oysters and jellyfish and more because they lack any sort of spinal cord, nervous system or brain. I personally find the taste of them disgusting, even when I ate meat. And I don't know if starfish has any sort of meat on it.\n\nEmpathizing with plants is like empathizing with fires and chemicals.

        "1556": "People like to think that it's an animal trait to like to stay alive, and protect and defend themselves, and plants are just totally inert. But that isn't true. Unlike animals, plants can't run away and escape danger, but plants are every bit as opposed to being killed and eaten as any animal is. Instead of running, plants engage in physical warfare: spikes and tough exteriors and all kinds of other things, and chemical warfare: releasing a number of different chemicals in response to being attacked by an herbivore. These responses fall into three main categories:\n\n1. Direct defense. Some chemicals released by plants, for example certain types of clover, are intended to directly harm the predator eating it. Many plants use cyanide as their poison of choice. Sometimes, to prevent poisoning themselves by accident, they'll even compartmentalize their cyanide into a two-part weapon system, storing a harmless, nontoxic cyanide precursor inside their cell cytoplasms, and storing an enzyme in their cell walls that break down that precursor into active, deadly cyanide. Getting munched on by a herbivore breaks the cell wall and mixes these ingredients, poisoning the predator. Things like producing the mating pheremones of the herbivore's natural predator, to attract that predator towards a free meal and saving the plant from attack, also fall under this category.\n\n2. Local repair. Some chemicals that plants release when they're damaged, such as jasmonic acid, serve as plant hormones that signal the rest of the plant to brace and prepare for damage. Plants constrict their water channels to avoid losing water through their damaged parts, produce saps and sticky coagulants to block off the damage, produce antibacterials and antifungals to protect against infection, increase cell replication to heal faster, and start producing bitter, foul-tasting molecules that discourage herbivores from continuing to eat them, as well as enzymes that block digestion, making itself less nutritious.\n\n3. Remote signaling. Many of the same chemicals that direct plants to start repairing themselves, such as jasmonic acid, are also highly volatile, and signal neighboring plants to start bracing for impact and preparing themselves as well. In response to distress signals given off by nearby plants that are being eaten, plants will produce bitterants and digestion-blockers, making themselves unpalpatable to their herbivore predators. In fact, this is the reason that giraffes have to be nomadic creatures: you never see a giraffe herd strip a tree completely bare, because after munching on a tree for some time, the tree becomes bitter and inedible, and depending on wind conditions, other trees for miles around become so too. So the herd has to keep moving, trying to stay ahead of the chemical cloud of anguished screaming their leaf-munching inspires, in order to keep finding new trees who are still supple, delicious, and haven't yet hardened themselves.\n\nOf course, plants can't tell the difference between an animal's teeth and a lawnmower's blade, so against us, all their chemical screams, poisons, and distress calls don't do them much good, and make a pleasant summertime perfume for us instead.",

Bio when we were on extracellular communication.\n\nGreen Leaf Volatiles (GLVs) are molecules found in any plant, including trees, ferns, grasses, etc. There are HUNDREDS of types of GLVs and each varies from plant to plant and from function to function. \n\nThe leaves of a tomato plant have GLVs that make the leaf taste bitter when being eaten, it's a defense mechanism to ensure that only the fruit and not the leaves of the plant are being eaten. The leaves of a cotton plant (IIRC) have a certain GLV that when released into the air signal for parasitic wasps to come eat and/or lay eggs in something that's eating them.\n\nWhen grasses like the ones in Plains areas or on your lawn are eaten in mass quantities and  lots of GLVs are released into the air, it can sometimes signal predators to come eat the herd of grazing animals.\n\nSome GLVs help the process of healing and clotting Xylem. Because Xylem helps carry water around the plant (much like our veins) they have to clot to avoid leaking all of the water. GLVs can also warn neighboring plants that they're about to get eaten so they should begin to produce chemicals that will help them after the damage is done.\n\nSide note on where/how they're stored: Green Leaf Volatiles are stored in the vacuole and when the vacuole is ruptured, the Green Leaf Volatiles quickly take to the air (volatiles means gas) and spread out.",

Humans like many smells that don't seem to serve any specific evolutionary \"purpose\"--though it's a mistake to view evolution as purposeful in the first place. Having cell receptors that recognize the organic compounds released when grass is cut and the majority of humans having the brain subsequently translate that scent into good or neutral could be purely coincidental; or, it might be linked to a general liking of the smells of vegetation during the spring and summer when food becomes plentiful again. It's impossible to say with certainty. However, I sincerely doubt the broad positive association with the smells of inedible plants is a result of collective childhood associations, anymore than liking the smell of a wood fire in the winter would be. (Also, there's no evidence that human palettes favor meat. What people like to eat is based on a combination of personal behaviors/opinions, genetics, culture, and whatever particular nutrients etc a person's body needs most. Cooked foods, which meat and animal fats often are, tend to increase salivary response--which signals appetite to the brain--more than raw fruits/vegetables because it triggers smell receptors more easily; however, freshly baked bread or the smell of a warm tomato sauce can produce similar responses. It's true we perceive fats to be rich and meat to be filling, but the body also craves sugar, incidentally derived from plant matter, more than those other two. Added sugars are the main reason why sodas and junk food are addictive.)",

There are surely some hints for this, but all papers that I have seen provide very limited data.

        "42": "&gt; &gt;The logic is a cow eats more plants than humans so eating a cow means one less cow. The whole idea that not eating cows is going to result in less vegetation being eaten is already disproved by the same research that tries to say eating more cows consumes more vegetation because of how much a cow eats. Becoming vegan isn't going to reduce the impact a cow will have on crops. It will just reduce demand for cow meat. \n\nYou don't seem to understand that less demand for cow meat means less demand for crops. One cow eats enough crops a day for more than ten human beings. Now multiply that by the billions.\n\n&gt;The list of traits i gave are not contradictory to the statement i made. They are all traits plants exhibit as well as reasons some vegans cite for not eating animals. \n\nPlants do not exhibit feelings, they exhibit stimuli.\n\n&gt;i don't see a blade of grass as being more important than a cow. I distinctly said i'm an omnivore because i believe all life has an equal right to live which means none are exclusively off of my diet. The same argument being made as to why i'm not a pure herbivore can be made for why i'm not a pure carnivore.\n\nIf all of them have an equal right to live, then why do you eat them? And I didn't say \"more important,\" I said \"the same as.\"\n\n&gt;The reason people are more disturbed by a cow getting it's throat slit more than potato is mainly because it has a face. There's been plenty of studies showing the further an animal is from having the basic two eyes, a nose, a mouth the less they are capable of empathizing with it.\n\nThis makes sense when it comes to the average human being.\n\nThe problem is, where is the \"life\" line drawn? How do you determine what has conscious life and what doesn't? Is my carpet conscious? My stuffed animals? We call things \"life as we know it\" because that's exactly what it is.\n\nYou seem to be against veganism for reasons that aren't concluded by science, and instead are ignoring what is concluded by science. There is no proof that plants feel pain, conscious or have a desire to live, they're about as alive as fire until we prove otherwise.\n\nPutting a cow in a confined space and cutting off beaks ARE required for mass production of meat. Even if everyone in the entire world were to eat meat once a year, the demand will still be incredibly high enough to require confined spaces and other acts of cruelty. You should really do some research on how businesses work.\n\nAnd not only that, but killing is cruel. The animals are terrified and know exactly what's about to happen before they die. Even on supposed \"\"\"humane\"\"\" farms.\n\n\n",

However, this may not be the case. \n\nSome of the studies about whether or not plants feel pain, for example, used sensors to detect the electrical activity within a plant.

From my perspective -- and again many others who are more qualified in this field -- I don't see why we would have subjectivity while plants wouldn't. We're both just systems of elementary particles moving according to the laws of physics, and apparently, we both use electricity to send information around our bodies.\n\nBy the way, I would like to make a side note to try to define what I mean by experience or subjectivity: I am not saying that plants (or cells) feel anything that we can identify with or relate to. If part of a plant is burned off, I don't think it has the same experience we have of being burned. I don't think they think in words or consider their place in the world or fall in love or any of these decidedly human traits.

These are fungi that form extremely close associations with plant roots, sometimes even within the roots themselves. These fungal networks are made up of hyphae (\"threads\" of fungi) which combine to form more substantial strands of fungi called mycelium. These mycelia connect through the soil to other fungi,, which in turn are likely connected to other mycorrhizal fungi. In fact fungal mycelium constitutes a significant part of most soils.\n\nNow these interconnected fungi can in fact be great highways for signaling, and are constantly communicating through the forest floor. But the plants have their own means of communication which is much more direct. The mycelia are not there specifically for communication, those effects are secondary.\n\nI expect you got your original term from Paul Stamets or one of his talks. He's a very interesting guy. I've worked with him in my current research project. While he is a great communicator and very knowledgeable, i do think he has a habit of embellishment when he describes these sorts of things. that said, I specialize in wood decay fungi, not mycorrhizae, so i'm out of my area of specific expertise. \n\nAnyway, its great to hear that you knew anything on the subject!

        "62": "The formatting is going to be weird because i'm on mobile so bear with me. \n&gt;The logic is a cow eats more plants than humans so eating a cow means one less cow. The whole idea that not eating cows is going to result in less vegetation being eaten is already disproved by the same research that tries to say eating more cows consumes more vegetation because of how much a cow eats. The becoming vegan isn't going to reduce the impact a cow will have on crops.  It will just reduce demand for cow meat. \n&gt;If you're referring to a venus flytrap specifically, it closes when you stick your finger in because your finger is made out of meat. You'll notice it doesn't react when a leaf or dust falls on it. There's actually a lot of research on it because of how rare it is in plant kingdom. What we lack is a full understanding of how it does this.\n&gt;Fire is just energy so it's not life but in let's take a hypothetical situation. Say we there's an energy based lifeform making it different than the carbon based life as we currently know it and it was capable of feelings. Say also we're capable of digesting it. In that scenerio i would eat it for the same reason i don't exclude the animal kingdom from my diet. The main reason people don't eat is because it would burn them and even then some people \"eat\" fire with their drinks and it just goes out. But the main answer to why is light ruled out? The answer is it isn't. That is a vegans logic and i agree with you that it is ridiculous.\n&gt;The list of traits i gave are not contradictory to the statement i made. They are all traits plants exhibit as well as reasons some vegans cite for not eating animals. \n&gt;The reason people are more disturbed by a cow getting it's throat slit more than potato is mainly because it has a face. There's been plenty of studies showing the further an animal is from having the basic two eyes, a nose, a mouth the less they are capable of empathizing with it. For example the average person that would feel bad about a cow being killed has no problem watching a spider or wasp or snake die.\n&gt;i don't see a blade of grass as being more important than a cow. I distinctly said i'm an omnivore because i believe all life has an equal right to live which means none are exclusively off of my diet. The same argument being made as to why i'm not a pure herbivore can be made for why i'm not a pure carnivore.\n&gt;additionally saying i hold the life of  blade of grass higher than a cow's is illogical. That would be like saying i hold the life of a nematode higher than a redwood. I wouldn't hold the life of the grass higher than the redwood's and i wouldn't hold the life of a nematode higher than a cow's. They're different sized organisms with different impacts on their environments as well as modern living. Some are greater and some are smaller but for me the kingdom they come from doesn't dictate their right live or be eaten. Plants aren't better than animals. Animals aren't better than plants. Fungi aren't better than protists or bacteria.\n&gt; In the end it's just a system of sorting we made because when there's a lot of data people tend to sort it. It's a descriptor of physical traits and i believe the rights of any form of life shouldn't be based on physical traits just like the rights of humans shouldn't be based of their physical characteristics or even mental capability. That also doesn't mean i support the unethical treatment of animals. Locking a cow in a confined space or cutting a chicken's beak off isn't a requirement for producing meat. Cruelty is the product of industry and trying to turn farms into factories and $$$. It's not the product of a person's diet.",

It comes back around to the whole, we can't empathize with plants because we don't have brains or consciousness like them. The idea that we should eat them \"because\" they \"might\" experience things the same way we do is not at all similar to the fact that animals in slaughterhouses do experience things the same way we do. And again, I still see no sources explaining your reasoning of eating less meat will kill more plants, if you care that much about them...\n\nLike I said earlier, no one is choosing who has the right to live. No one is playing god. But it's much easier to empathize with our own, you know, animals who feel things the same way we do, who are sentient, and who we can see suffer the same way we do. Plants don't. There's no research saying otherwise. I've owned carnivorous plants, they don't need to eat meat to survive, and everything is stimuli based. I could put my finger in it and move it around and it will close and try to eat it. It doesn't know it's a finger, it's reacting based on stimuli. \n\n&gt;You wouldn't go around saying a chicken doesn't have feelings or coral doesn't have a brain so it was made solely for us to use as a resource. \n\nAgain, I have no idea what point you're trying to make here.

You are taking all living organisms and lumping them into one group and saying they should all have a right to live. By why not fire? Who says elements don't have feelings or react to light and stimuli? Why are they ruled out? Do you see how ridiculous this discussion gets?\n\n&gt;Again if you came across a version of \"life as we don't know it\" and it could feel fear, think, move, react to pain but not speak a vegan would eat it because that's what they're doing to plants.\n\nNot true, I have no idea where this came from, as it contradicts your earlier statements.\n\nPeople get disturbed by a cow having its throat slit, but never a potato being pulled out of the ground.

We often talk in terms of creatures \"wanting\" to do A or B, because thinking in terms of intent, consciousness and desire is how we understand each other and our default mode when thinking about the world, too. \n\nYou're totally right, though: the plant doesn't have an opinion on living or dying. Mutations create a bunch of different random molecules that could be produced by a population of plants. Most probably don't do anything, but some rare ones hurt predators who bite into them. The plants that produce those get nibbled on less, and reproduce more, so as the plants who don't make it go extinct, that mutant plant's descendants take over. More mutations tweak that molecule, and maybe one is even nastier, so that plant survives even better.\n\nAnd of course, the predator is evolving too; in a few generations, among this population of hypothetical plants, this toxin used to be a rarity but now the majority of plants have it; plants without are getting scarcer and scarcer, and most of the predators starve and go hungry. Enter a random mutation that makes them more resistant to the poison- now poison-resistant herbivores spread again, eating those poisonous plants.\n\nThe plant \"evolves\" defenses, and the predator \"evolves\" counters, but no step along the way requires conscious intent. Evolution happens due to three simple, basic principles:\n\n1. Organisms resemble their parents\n2. Offspring are not perfect copies- mutations and variation happens\n3. These variations can affect the organism's ability to survive and reproduce\n\nThose three rules plus time, is evolution in a nutshell.",

In other words, would the plant have evolved to call the insect or is it just luck of adaptability that a predator insect upgraded to detect the petricor smell?",

That's the fuck zone.\n\nWe're important to the local community, because our so-called destructiveness renews entire sections of the forest, allowing for new growth. We bark beetles call it creating complex early successional forest. We also get rid of diseased trees. You're welcome. \n\nI have family in Asia who keep fungus farms; they call the stuff \"Ambrosia\" and they basically live off of it. They also use the chemicals in it to bypass trees' security systems. They're cool and I'd love to visit them but how am I going to get to Asia, for real.\n\n",
