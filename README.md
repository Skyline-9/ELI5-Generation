# ELI5-Generation

Based off the Reddit forum "Explain Like I'm 5," ELI5-Generation is a model for long-form question answering where this model generates simple explanations in response to a diverse array of open-ended questions using supporting documents from the web. Compared to some datasets, ELI5 often requires multi-sentence answers, but each answer should be simple enough such that it's comprehensible by a 5-year-old.
